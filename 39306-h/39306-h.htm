<pre xml:space="preserve">
     I Am Ordered to Leave Vienna&mdash;The Empress Moderates but Does
     Not Annul the Order&mdash;Zavoiski at Munich&mdash;My Stay at
     Augsburg&mdash;Gasconnade at Louisburg&mdash;The Cologne Newspaper&mdash;
     My Arrival at Aix-la-Chapelle
</pre>
    <p>
      The greatest mistake a man that punishes a knave can commit is to leave
      the said rogue alive, for he is certain to take vengeance. If I had had my
      sword in the den of thieves, I should no doubt have defended myself, but
      it would have gone ill with me, three against one, and I should probably
      have been cut to pieces, while the murderers would have escaped
      unpunished.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o&rsquo;clock Campioni came to see me in my bed, and was astonished at
      my adventure. Without troubling himself to compassionate me, we both began
      to think how we could get back my purse; but we came to the conclusion
      that it would be impossible, as I had nothing more than my mere assertion
      to prove the case. In spite of that, however, I wrote out the whole story,
      beginning with the girl who recited the Latin verses. I intended to bring
      the document before the police; however, I had not time to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was just sitting down to dinner, when an agent of the police came and
      gave me an order to go and speak to Count Schrotembach, the Statthalter. I
      told him to instruct my coachman, who was waiting at the door, and that I
      would follow him shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I called on the Statthalter, I found him to be a thick-set
      individual; he was standing up, and surrounded by men who seemed ready to
      execute his orders. When he saw me, he shewed me a watch, and requested me
      to note the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are at Vienna at that time to-morrow I shall have you expelled
      from the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you give me such an unjust order?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, I am not here to give you accounts or reasons for my
      actions. However, I may tell you that you are expelled for playing at
      games of chance, which are forbidden by the laws under pain of the
      galleys. Do you recognize that purse and these cards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not know the cards, but I knew the purse which had been stolen from
      me. I was in a terrible rage, and I only replied by presenting the
      magistrate with the truthful narrative of what had happened to me. He read
      it, and then said with a laugh that I was well known to be a man of parts,
      that my character was known, that I had been expelled from Warsaw, and
      that as for the document before him he judged it to be a pack of lies,
      since in his opinion it was altogether void of probability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fine,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you will obey my order to leave the town, and you
      must tell me where you are going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you that when I have made up my mind to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? You dare to tell me that you will not obey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You yourself have said that if I do not go I shall be removed by force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. I have heard you have a strong will, but here it will be of no
      use to you. I advise you to go quietly, and so avoid harsh measures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I request you to return me that document.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not do so. Begone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was one of the most terrible moments of my life. I shudder still when
      I think of it. It was only a cowardly love of life that hindered me from
      running my sword through the body of the Statthalter, who had treated me
      as if he were a hangman and not a judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I went away I took it into my head to complain to Prince Kaunitz,
      though I had not the honour of knowing him. I called at his house, and a
      man I met told me to stay in the ante-chamber, as the prince would pass
      through to go to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was five o&rsquo;clock. The prince appeared, followed by his guests, amongst
      whom was M. Polo Renieri, the Venetian ambassador. The prince asked me
      what he could do for me, and I told my story in a loud voice before them
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have received my order to go, but I shall not obey. I implore your
      highness to give me your protection, and to help me to bring my plea to
      the foot of the throne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write out your petition,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and I will see that the empress
      gets it. But I advise you to ask her majesty for a respite, for if you say
      that you won&rsquo;t obey, she will be predisposed against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if the royal grace does not place me in security, I shall be driven
      away by violence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take refuge with the ambassador of your native country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, my lord, my country has forsaken me. An act of legal though
      unconstitutional violence has deprived me of my rights as a citizen. My
      name is Casanova, and my country is Venice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince looked astonished and turned to the Venetian ambassador, who
      smiled, and whispered to him for ten minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; said the prince, kindly, &ldquo;that you cannot claim the
      protection of any ambassador.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words a nobleman of colossal stature stepped forward and said I
      could claim his protection, as my whole family, myself included, had
      served the prince his master. He spoke the truth, for he was the
      ambassador of Saxony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Count Vitzthum,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;Write to the empress, and I
      will forward your petition immediately. If there is any delay in the
      answer, go to the count; you will be safe with him, until you like to
      leave Vienna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile the prince ordered writing materials to be brought me,
      and he and his guests passed into the dining-hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      I give here a copy of the petition, which I composed in less than ten
      minutes. I made a fair copy for the Venetian ambassador to send home to
      the Senate:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MADAM,&mdash;I am sure that if, as your royal and imperial highness were
      walking in your garden, an insect appealed plaintively to you not to crush
      it, you would turn aside, and so avoid doing the poor creature any hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, madam, am an insect, and I beg of you that you will order M.
      Statthalter Schrotembach to delay crushing me with your majesty&rsquo;s slipper
      for a week. Possibly, after that time has elapsed, your majesty will not
      only prevent his crushing me, but will deprive him of that slipper, which
      was only meant to be the terror of rogues, and not of an humble Venetian,
      who is an honest man, though he escaped from The Leads.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;In profound submission to your majesty&rsquo;s will,
   &ldquo;I remain,
               &ldquo;CASANOVA.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Given at Vienna, January 21st, 1769.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I had finished the petition, I made a fair draft of it, and sent it
      in to the prince, who sent it back to me telling me that he would place it
      in the empress&rsquo;s hands immediately, but that he would be much obliged by
      my making a copy for his own use.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did so, and gave both copies to the valet de chambre, and went my way. I
      trembled like a paralytic, and was afraid that my anger might get me into
      difficulty. By way of calming myself, I wrote out in the style of a
      manifesto the narrative I had given to the vile Schrotembach, and which
      that unworthy magistrate had refused to return to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o&rsquo;clock Count Vitzthum came into my room. He greeted me in a
      friendly manner and begged me to tell him the story of the girl I had gone
      to see, on the promise of the Latin quatrain referring to her
      accommodating disposition. I gave him the address and copied out the
      verses, and he said that was enough to convince an enlightened judge that
      I had been slandered; but he, nevertheless, was very doubtful whether
      justice would be done me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! shall I be obliged to leave Vienna to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, the empress cannot possibly refuse you the week&rsquo;s delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no one could refuse such an appeal as that. Even the prince could not
      help smiling as he was reading it in his cold way. After reading it he
      passed it on to me, and then to the Venetian ambassador, who asked him if
      he meant to give it to the empress as it stood. &lsquo;This petition,&rsquo; replied
      the prince, &lsquo;might be sent to God, if one knew the way;&rsquo; and forthwith he
      ordered one of his secretaries to fold it up and see that it was
      delivered. We talked of you for the rest of dinner, and I had the pleasure
      of hearing the Venetian ambassador say that no one could discover any
      reason for your imprisonment under the Leads. Your duel was also
      discussed, but on that point we only knew what has appeared in the
      newspapers. Oblige me by giving me a copy of your petition; that phrase of
      Schrotembach and the slipper pleased me vastly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I copied out the document, and gave it him with a copy of my manifesto.
      Before he left me the count renewed the invitation to take refuge with
      him, if I did not hear from the empress before the expiration of the
      twenty-four hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o&rsquo;clock I had a visit from the Comte de la Perouse, the Marquis de
      las Casas, and Signor Uccelli, the secretary of the Venetian embassy. The
      latter came to ask for a copy of my petition for his chief. I promised he
      should have it, and I also sent a copy of my manifesto. The only thing
      which rather interfered with the dignity of this latter piece, and gave it
      a somewhat comic air, were the four Latin verses, which might make people
      imagine that, after enjoying the girl as Hebe, I had gone in search of her
      as Ganymede. This was not the case, but the empress understood Latin and
      was familiar with mythology, and if she had looked on it in the light I
      have mentioned I should have been undone. I made six copies of the two
      documents before I went to bed; I was quite tired out, but the exertion
      had somewhat soothed me. At noon the next day, young Hasse (son of the
      chapel-master and of the famous Trustina), secretary of legation to Count
      Vitzthum, came to tell me from the ambassador that nobody would attack me
      in my own house, nor in my carriage if I went abroad, but that it would be
      imprudent to go out on foot. He added that his chief would have the
      pleasure of calling on me at seven o&rsquo;clock. I begged M. Hasse to let me
      have all this in writing, and after he had written it out he left me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the order to leave Vienna had been suspended; it must have been done
      by the sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no time to lose,&rdquo; said I to myself, &ldquo;I shall have justice done me,
      my assassins will be condemned, my purse will be returned with the two
      hundred ducats in it, and not in the condition in which it was shewn to me
      by the infamous Schrotembach, who will be punished by dismissal, at
      least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such were my castles in Spain; who has not built such? &lsquo;Quod nimis miseri
      volunt hoc facile credunt&rsquo;, says Seneca. The wish is father to the
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before sending my manifesto to the empress, Prince Kaunitz, and to all the
      ambassadors, I thought it would be well to call on the Countess of Salmor,
      who spoke to the sovereign early and late. I had had a letter of
      introduction for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She greeted me by saying that I had better give up wearing my arm in a
      sling, as it looked as ii I were a charlatan; my arm must be well enough
      after nine months.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was extremely astonished by this greeting, and replied that if it were
      not necessary I should not wear a sling, and that I was no charlatan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;I have come to see you on a different matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, but I will have nothing to do with it. You are all as bad as
      Tomatis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave a turn round and left the room without taking any further notice of
      her. I returned home feeling overwhelmed by the situation. I had been
      robbed and insulted by a band of thorough-paced rascals; I could do
      nothing, justice was denied me, and now I had been made a mock of by a
      worthless countess. If I had received such an insult from a man I would
      have soon made him feel the weight of one arm at all events. I could not
      bear my arm without a sling for an hour; pain and swelling set in
      immediately. I was not perfectly cured till twenty months after the duel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Vitzthum came to see me at seven o&rsquo;clock. He said the empress had
      told Prince Kaunitz that Schrotembach considered my narrative as pure
      romance. His theory was that I had held a bank at faro with sharpers&rsquo;
      cards, and had dealt with both hands the arm in the sling being a mere
      pretence. I had then been taken in the act by one of the gamesters, and my
      unjust gains had been very properly taken from me. My detector had then
      handed over my purse, containing forty ducats, to the police, and the
      money had of course been confiscated. The empress had to choose between
      believing Schrotembach and dismissing him; and she was not inclined to do
      the latter, as it would be a difficult matter to find him a successor in
      his difficult and odious task of keeping Vienna clear of human vermin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what Prince Kaunitz asked me to tell you. But you need not be
      afraid of any violence, and you can go when you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am to be robbed of two hundred ducats with impunity. The empress
      might at least reimburse me if she does nothing more. Please to ask the
      prince whether I can ask the sovereign to give me that satisfaction; the
      least I can demand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell him what you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not, I shall leave; for what can I do in a town where I can only
      drive, and where the Government keeps assassins in its pay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. We are all sure that Pocchini has calumniated you. The
      girl who recites Latin verses is well known, but none know her address. I
      must advise you not to publish your tale as long as you are in Vienna, as
      it places Schrotembach in a very bad light, and you see the empress has to
      support him in the exercise of his authority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see the force of your argument, and I shall have to devour my anger. I
      will leave Vienna as soon as the washerwoman sends home my linen, but I
      will have the story printed in all its black injustice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The empress is prejudiced against you, I don&rsquo;t know by whom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, though; it is that infernal old hag, Countess Salmor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day I received a letter from Count Vitzthum, in which he said
      that Prince Kaunitz advised me to forget the two hundred ducats, that the
      girl and her so-called mother had left Vienna to all appearance, as
      someone had gone to the address and had failed to find her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that I could do nothing, and resolved to depart in peace, and
      afterwards to publish the whole story and to hang Pocchini with my own
      hands when next I met him. I did neither the one nor the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      About that time a young lady of the Salis de Coire family arrived at
      Vienna without any companion. The imperial hangman Schrotembach, ordered
      her to leave Vienna in two days. She replied that she would leave exactly
      when she felt inclined. The magistrate consigned her to imprisonment in a
      convent, and she was there still when I left. The emperor went to see her,
      and the empress, his mother, asked him what he thought of her. His answer
      was, &ldquo;I thought her much more amusing than Schrotembach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly, every man worthy of the name longs to be free, but who is
      really free in this world? No one. The philosopher, perchance, may be
      accounted so, but it is at the cost of too precious sacrifices at the
      phantom shrine of Liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left the use of my suite of rooms, for which I had paid a month in
      advance, to Campioni, promising to wait for him at Augsburg, where the Law
      alone is supreme. I departed alone carrying with me the bitter regret that
      I had not been able to kill the monster, whose despotism had crushed me. I
      stopped at Linz on purpose to write to Schrotembach even a more bitter
      letter than that which I had written to the Duke of Wurtemburg in 1760. I
      posted it myself, and had it registered so as to be sure of its reaching
      the scoundrel to whom it had been addressed. It was absolutely necessary
      for me to write this letter, for rage that has no vent must kill at last.
      From Linz I had a three days&rsquo; journey to Munich, where I called on Count
      Gaetan Zavoicki, who died at Dresden seven years ago. I had known him at
      Venice when he was in want, and I had happily been useful to him. On my
      relating the story of the robbery that had been committed on me, he no
      doubt imagined I was in want, and gave me twenty-five louis. To tell the
      truth it was much less than what I had given him at Venice, and if he had
      looked upon his action as paying back a debt we should not have been
      quits; but as I had never wished him to think that I had lent, not given
      him money, I received the present gratefully. He also gave me a letter for
      Count Maximilian Lamberg, marshal at the court of the Prince-Bishop of
      Augsburg, whose acquaintance I had the honour of having.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no theatre then in Augsburg, but there were masked balls in
      which all classes mingled freely. There were also small parties where faro
      was played for small stakes. I was tired of the pleasure, the misfortune,
      and the griefs I had had in three capitals, and I resolved to spend four
      months in the free city of Augsburg, where strangers have the same
      privileges as the canons. My purse was slender, but with the economical
      life I led I had nothing to fear on that score. I was not far from Venice,
      where a hundred ducats were always at my service if I wanted them. I
      played a little and waged war against the sharpers who have become more
      numerous of late than the dupes, as there are also more doctors than
      patients. I also thought of getting a mistress, for what is life without
      love? I had tried in vain to retrace Gertrude; the engraver was dead, and
      no one knew what had become of his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three days before the end of the carnival I went to a hirer of
      carriages, as I had to go to a ball at some distance from the town. While
      the horses were being put in, I entered the room to warm my hands, for the
      weather was very cold. A girl came up and asked me if I would drink a
      glass of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I; and on the question being repeated, repeated the
      monosyllable somewhat rudely. The girl stood still and began to laugh, and
      I was about to turn angrily away when she said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you do not remember me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her attentively, and at last I discovered beneath her
      unusually ugly features the lineaments of Anna Midel, the maid in the
      engraver&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remind me of Anna Midel,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, I was Anna Midel once. I am no longer an object fit for love, but
      that is your fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the four hundred florins you gave me made Count Fugger&rsquo;s coachman
      marry me, and he not only abandoned me but gave me a disgusting disease,
      which was like to have been my death. I recovered my health, but I never
      shall recover my good looks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry to hear all this; but tell me what has become of
      Gertrude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know that you are going to a ball at her house to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. After her father&rsquo;s death she married a well-to-do and respectable
      man, and I expect you will be pleased with the entertainment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she pretty still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is just as she used to be, except that she is six years older and has
      had children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she gallant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anna had spoken the truth. Gertrude was pleased to see me, and introduced
      me to her husband as one of her father&rsquo;s old lodgers, and I had altogether
      a pleasant welcome; but, on sounding her, I found she entertained those
      virtuous sentiments which might have been expected under the
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Campioni arrived at Augsburg at the beginning of Lent. He was in company
      with Binetti, who was going to Paris. He had completely despoiled his
      wife, and had left her for ever. Campioni told me that no one at Vienna
      doubted my story in the slightest degree. Pocchini and the Sclav had
      disappeared a few days after my departure, and the Statthalter had
      incurred a great deal of odium by his treatment of me. Campioni spent a
      month with me, and then went on to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      I called on Count Lamberg and his countess, who, without being beautiful,
      was an epitome of feminine charm and amiability. Her name before marriage
      was Countess Dachsberg. Three months after my arrival, this lady, who was
      enciente, but did not think her time was due, went with Count Fugger, dean
      of the chapter, to a party of pleasure at an inn three quarters of a
      league from Augsburg. I was present; and in the course of the meal she was
      taken with such violent pains that she feared she would be delivered on
      the spot. She did not like to tell the noble canon, and thinking that I
      was more likely to be acquainted with such emergencies she came up to me
      and told me all. I ordered the coachman to put in his horses instantly,
      and when the coach was ready I took up the countess and carried her to it.
      The canon followed us in blank astonishment, and asked me what was the
      matter. I told him to bid the coachman drive fast and not to spare his
      horses. He did so, but he asked again what was the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The countess will be delivered of a child if we do not make haste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought I should be bound to laugh, in spite of my sympathies for the
      poor lady&rsquo;s pains, when I saw the dean turn green and white and purple,
      and look as if he were going into a fit, as he realized that the countess
      might be delivered before his eyes in his own carriage. The poor man
      looked as grievously tormented as St. Laurence on his gridiron. The bishop
      was at Plombieres; they would write and tell him! It would be in all the
      papers! &ldquo;Quick! coachman, quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We got to the castle before it was too late. I carried the lady into her
      room, and they ran for a surgeon and a midwife. It was no good, however,
      for in five minutes the count came out and said the countess had just been
      happily delivered. The dean looked as if a weight had been taken off his
      mind; however, he took the precaution of having himself blooded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent an extremely pleasant four months at Augsburg, supping twice or
      thrice a week at Count Lamberg&rsquo;s. At these suppers I made the acquaintance
      of a very remarkable man&mdash;Count Thura and Valsamina, then a page in
      the prince-bishop&rsquo;s household, now Dean of Ratisbon. He was always at the
      count&rsquo;s, as was also Dr. Algardi, of Bologna, the prince&rsquo;s physician and a
      delightful man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I often saw at the same house a certain Baron Sellenthin, a Prussian
      officer, who was always recruiting for his master at Augsburg. He was a
      pleasant man, somewhat in the Gascon style, soft-spoken, and an expert
      gamester. Five or six years ago I had a letter from him dated Dresden, in
      which he said that though he was old, and had married a rich wife, he
      repented of having married at all. I should say the same if I had ever
      chanced to marry.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my stay at Augsburg several Poles, who had left their country on
      account of the troubles, came to see me. Amongst others was Rzewuski, the
      royal Prothonotary, whom I had known at St. Petersburg as the lover of
      poor Madame Langlade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a diet! What plots! What counterplots! What misfortunes!&rdquo; said this
      honest Pole, to me. &ldquo;Happy are they who have nothing to do with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was going to Spa, and he assured me that if I followed him I should
      find Prince Adam&rsquo;s sister, Tomatis, and Madame Catai, who had become the
      manager&rsquo;s wife. I determined to go to Spa, and to take measures so that I
      might go there with three or four hundred ducats in my purse. To this
      intent I wrote to Prince Charles of Courland, who was at Venice, to send
      me a hundred ducats, and in my letter I gave him an infallible receipt for
      the philosopher&rsquo;s stone. The letter containing this vast secret was not in
      cypher, so I advised him to burn it after he had read it, assuring him
      that I possessed a copy. He did not do so, and it was taken to Paris with
      his order papers when he was sent to the Bastile.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it had not been for the Revolution my letter would never have seen the
      light. When the Bastille was destroyed, my letter was found and printed
      with other curious compositions, which were afterwards translated into
      German and English. The ignorant fools that abound in the land where my
      fate wills that I should write down the chief events of my long and
      troublous life&mdash;these fools, I say, who are naturally my sworn foes
      (for the ass lies not down with the horse), make this letter an article of
      accusation against me, and think they can stop my mouth by telling me that
      the letter has been translated into German, and remains to my eternal
      shame. The ignorant Bohemians are astonished when I tell them that I
      regard the letter as redounding to my glory, and that if their ears were
      not quite so long their blame would be turned into praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know whether my letter has been correctly translated, but since
      it has become public property I shall set it down here in homage to truth,
      the only god I adore. I have before me an exact copy of the original
      written in Augsburg in the year 1767, and we are now in the year 1798.
    </p>
    <p>
      It runs as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY LORD,&mdash;I hope your highness will either burn this letter after
      reading it, or else preserve it with the greatest care. It will be better,
      however, to make a copy in cypher, and to burn the original. My attachment
      to you is not my only motive in writing; I confess my interest is equally
      concerned. Allow me to say that I do not wish your highness to esteem me
      alone for any qualities you may have observed in me; I wish you to become
      my debtor by the inestimable secret I am going to confide to you. This
      secret relates to the making of gold, the only thing of which your
      highness stands in need. If you had been miserly by nature you would be
      rich now; but you are generous, and will be poor all your days if you do
      not make use of my secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your highness told me at Riga that you would like me to give you the
      secret by which I transmuted iron into copper; I never did so, but now I
      shall teach you how to make a much more marvellous transmutation. I should
      point out to you, however, that you are not at present in a suitable place
      for the operation, although all the materials are easily procurable. The
      operation necessitates my presence for the construction of a furnace, and
      for the great care necessary, far the least mistake will spoil all. The
      transmutation of Mars is an easy and merely mechanical process, but that
      of gold is philosophical in the highest degree. The gold produced will be
      equal to that used in the Venetian sequins. You must reflect, my lord,
      that I am giving you information which will permit you to dispense with
      me, and you must also reflect that I am confiding to you my life and my
      liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The step I am taking should insure your life-long protection, and should
      raise you above that prejudice which is entertained against the general
      mass of alchemists. My vanity would be wounded if you refuse to
      distinguish me from the common herd of operators. All I ask you is that
      you will wait till we meet before undertaking the process. You cannot do
      it by yourself, and if you employ any other person but myself, you will
      betray the secret. I must tell you that, using the same materials, and by
      the addition of mercury and nitre, I made the tree of projection for the
      Marchioness d&rsquo;Urfe and the Princess of Anhalt. Zerbst calculated the
      profit as fifty per cent. My fortune would have been made long ago, if I
      had found a prince with the control of a mint whom I could trust. Your
      character enables me to confide in you. However, we will come to the
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take four ounces of good silver, dissolve in aqua fortis,
      precipitate secundum artem with copper, then wash in lukewarm water to
      separate the acids; dry, mix with half an ounce of sal ammoniac, and place
      in a suitable vessel. Afterwards you must take a pound of alum, a pound of
      Hungary crystals, four ounces of verdigris, four ounces of cinnabar, and
      two ounces of sulphur. Pulverise and mix, and place in a retort of such
      size that the above matters will only half fill it. This retort must be
      placed over a furnace with four draughts, for the heat must be raised to
      the fourth degree. At first your fire must be slow so as to extract the
      gross phlegm of the matter, and when the spirit begins to appear, place
      the receiver under the retort, and Luna with the ammoniac salts will
      appear in it. All the joinings must be luted with the Philosophical
      Luting, and as the spirit comes, so regulate your furnace, but do not let
      it pass the third degree of heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So soon as the sublimation begins then boldly open your forth vent, but
      take heed that that which is sublimed pass not into the receiver where is
      your Luna, and so you must shut the mouth of the retort closely, and keep
      it so for twenty-four hours, and then take off your fastenings, and allow
      the distillation to go on. Then you must increase your fire so that the
      spirits may pass, over, until the matter in the retort is quite
      desiccated. After this operation has been performed three times, then you
      shall see the gold appear in the retort. Then draw it forth and melt it,
      adding your corpus perfectum. Melt with it two ounces of gold, then lay it
      in water, and you shall find four ounces of pure gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such my lord, is the gold mine for your mint of Mitau, by which, with the
      assistance of a manager and four men, you can assure yourself a revenue of
      a thousand ducats a week, and double, and quadruple that sum, if your
      highness chooses to increase the men and the furnaces. I ask your highness
      to make me your manager. But remember it must be a State secret, so burn
      this letter, and if your highness would give me any reward in advance, I
      only ask you to give me your affection and esteem. I shall be happy if I
      have reason to believe that my master will also be my friend. My life,
      which this letter places in your power, is ever at your service, and I
      know not what I shall do if I ever have cause to repent having disclosed
      my secret. I have the honour to be, etc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In whatever language this letter may have been translated, if its sense
      run not as above, it is not my letter, and I am ready to give the lie to
      all the Mirabeaus in the world. I have been called an exile, but
      wrongfully, for a man who has to leave a country by virtue of a &lsquo;lettre de
      cachet&rsquo; is no exile. He is forced to obey a despotic monarch who looks
      upon his kingdom as his house, and turns out of doors anyone who meets
      with his displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as my purse swelled to a respectable size, I left Augsburg, The
      date of my departure was June 14th, 1767. I was at Ulm when a courier of
      the Duke of Wurtemburg&rsquo;s passed through the town with the news that his
      highness would arrive from Venice in the course of five or six days. This
      courier had a letter for me. It had been entrusted to him by Prince
      Charles of Courland, who had told the courier that he would find me at the
      &ldquo;Hotel du Raisin,&rdquo; in Augsburg. As it happened, I had left the day before,
      but knowing the way by which I had gone he caught me up at Ulm. He gave me
      the letter and asked me if I were the same Casanova who had been placed
      under arrest and had escaped, on account of some gambling dispute with
      three officers. As I was never an adept in concealing the truth, I replied
      in the affirmative. A Wurtemburg officer who was standing beside us
      observed to me in a friendly manner that he was at Stuttgart at the time,
      and that most people concurred in blaming the three officers for their
      conduct in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without making any reply I read the letter, which referred to our private
      affairs, but as I was reading it I resolved to tell a little lie&mdash;one
      of those lies which do nobody any harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; I said to the officer, &ldquo;his highness, your sovereign, has
      listened to reason at last, and this letter informs me of a reparation
      which is in every way satisfactory. The duke has created me his private
      secretary, with a salary of twelve hundred a year. But I have waited for
      it a long time. God knows what has become of the three officers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are all at Louisburg, and &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; is now a colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they will be surprised to hear my news, and they will hear it
      to-morrow, for I am leaving this place in an hour. If they are at
      Louisburg, I shall have a triumph; but I am sorry not to be able to
      accompany you, however we shall see each other the day after tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had an excellent night, and awoke with the beautiful idea of going to
      Louisburg, not to fight the three officers but to frighten them, triumph
      over them, and to enjoy a pleasant vengeance for the injury they had done
      me. I should at the same time see a good many old friends; there was
      Madame Toscani, the duke&rsquo;s mistress; Baletti, and Vestri, who had married
      a former mistress of the duke&rsquo;s. I had sounded the depths of the human
      heart, and knew I had nothing to fear. The duke was on the point of
      returning, and nobody would dream of impugning the truth of my story. When
      he actually did arrive he would not find me, for as soon as the courier
      announced his approach I should go away, telling everybody that I had
      orders to precede his highness, and everybody would be duped.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never had so pleasant an idea before. I was quite proud of it, and I
      should have despised myself if I had failed to carry it into effect. It
      would be my vengeance on the duke, who could not have forgotten the
      terrible letter I had written him; for princes do not forget small
      injuries as they forget great services.
    </p>
    <p>
      I slept badly the following night, my anxiety was so great, and I reached
      Louisburg and gave my name at the town gates, without the addition of my
      pretended office, for my jest must be matured by degrees. I went to stay
      at the posting-inn, and just as I was asking for the address of Madame
      Toscani, she and her husband appeared on the scene. They both flung their
      arms around my neck, and overwhelmed me with compliments on my wounded arm
      and the victory I had achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What victory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your appearance here has filled the hearts of all your friends with joy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I certainly am in the duke&rsquo;s service, but how did you find it out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the common talk. The courier who gave you the letter has spread it
      all abroad, and the officer who was present and arrived here yesterday
      morning confirmed it. But you cannot imagine the consternation of your
      three foes. However, we are afraid that you will have some trouble with
      them, as they have kept your letter of defiance given from Furstenberg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t they meet me, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two of them could not go, and the third arrived too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. If the duke has no objection I shall be happy to meet them one
      after another, not three all at once. Of course, the duel must be with
      pistols; a sword duel is out of the question with my arm in a sling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will speak of that again. My daughter wants to make peace before the
      duke comes, and you had better consent to arrangements, for there are
      three of them, and it isn&rsquo;t likely that you could kill the whole three one
      after the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your daughter must have grown into a beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must stop with us this evening; you will see her, for she is no
      longer the duke&rsquo;s mistress. She is going to get married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your daughter can bring about an arrangement I would gladly fall in
      with it, provided it is an honourable one for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it that you are wearing the sling after all these months?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite cured, and yet my arm swells as soon as I let it swing loose.
      You shall see it after dinner, for you must dine with me if you want me to
      sup with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next came Vestri, whom I did not know, accompanied by my beloved Baletti.
      With them was an officer who was in love with Madame Toscani&rsquo;s second
      daughter, and another of their circle, with whom I was also unacquainted.
      They all came to congratulate me on my honourable position in the duke&rsquo;s
      service. Baletti was quite overcome with delight. The reader will
      recollect that he was my chief assistant in my escape from Stuttgart, and
      that I was once going to marry his sister. Baletti was a fine fellow, and
      the duke was very fond of him. He had a little country house, with a spare
      room, which he begged me to accept, as he said he was only too proud that
      the duke should know him as my best friend. When his highness came, of
      course I would have an apartment in the palace. I accepted; and as it was
      still early, we all went to see the young Toscani. I had loved her in
      Paris before her beauty had reached its zenith, and she was naturally
      proud to shew me how beautiful she had become. She shewed me her house and
      her jewels, told me the story of her amours with the duke, of her breaking
      with him on account of his perpetual infidelities, and of her marriage
      with a man she despised, but who was forced on her by her position.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner-time we all went to the inn, where we met the offending colonel;
      he was the first to take off his hat, we returned the salute, and he
      passed on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was a pleasant one, and when it was over I proceeded to take up
      my quarters with Baletti. In the evening we went to Madame Toscani&rsquo;s,
      where I saw two girls of ravishing beauty, Madame Toscani&rsquo;s daughter and
      Vestri&rsquo;s wife, of whom the duke had had two children. Madame Vestri was a
      handsome woman, but her wit and the charm of her manner enchanted me still
      more. She had only one fault&mdash;she lisped.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a certain reserve about the manner of Mdlle. Toscani, so I
      chiefly addressed myself to Madame Vestri, whose husband was not jealous,
      for he neither cared for her nor she for him. On the day of my arrival the
      manager had distributed the parts of a little play which was to be given
      in honour of the duke&rsquo;s arrival. It had been written by a local author, in
      hopes of its obtaining the favour of the Court for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper the little piece was discussed. Madame Vestri played the
      principal part, which she was prevailed upon to recite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your elocution is admirable, and your expression full of spirit,&rdquo; I
      observed; &ldquo;but what a pity it is that you do not pronounce the dentals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole table scouted my opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beauty, not a defect,&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;It makes her acting soft and
      delicate; other actresses envy her the privilege of what you call a
      defect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made no answer, but looked at Madame Vestri.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I am taken in by all that?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are much too sensible to believe such nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer a man to say honestly, &lsquo;what a pity,&rsquo; than to hear all that
      foolish flattery. But I am sorry to say that there is no remedy for the
      defect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No remedy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, I have an infallible remedy for your complaint. You shall give
      me a good hearty blow if I do not make you read the part perfectly by
      to-morrow, but if I succeed in making you read it as your husband, for
      example&rsquo;s sake, might read it you shall permit me to give you a tender
      embrace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; but what must I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must let me weave a spell over your part, that is all. Give it to me.
      To-morrow morning at nine o&rsquo;clock I will bring it to you to get my blow or
      my kiss, if your husband has no objection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever; but we do not believe in spells.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, in a general way; but mine will not fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Vestri left me the part, and the conversation turned on other
      subjects. I was condoled with on my swollen hand, and I told the story of
      my duel. Everybody seemed to delight in entertaining me and feasting me,
      and I went back to Baletti&rsquo;s in love with all the ladies, but especially
      with Madame Vestri and Mdlle. Toscani.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baletti had a beautiful little girl of three years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get that angel?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s her mother; and, as a proof of my hospitality, she shall sleep
      with you to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept your generous offer; but let it be to-morrow night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I shall be engaged all night in weaving my spell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? I thought that was a joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am quite serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a little crazy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall see. Do you go to bed, and leave me a light and writing
      materials.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I spent six hours in copying out the part, only altering certain phrases.
      For all words in which the letter r appeared I substituted another. It was
      a tiresome task, but I longed to embrace Madame Vestri before her husband.
      I set about my task in the following manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      The text ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Les procedes de cet homme m&rsquo;outragent et me deseparent, je dois penser a
      me debarrasser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For this I substituted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cet homme a des facons qui m&rsquo;offensent et me desolent, il faut que je
      m&rsquo;en defasse;&rdquo; and so on throughout the piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had finished I slept for three hours, and then rose and dressed.
      Baletti saw my spell, and said I had earned the curses of the young
      author, as Madame Vestri would no doubt make him write all parts for her
      without using the letter &lsquo;r&rsquo;; and, indeed, that was just what she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      I called on the actress and found her getting up. I gave her the part, and
      as soon as she saw what I had done she burst out into exclamations of
      delight; and calling her husband shewed him my contrivance, and said she
      would never play a part with an &lsquo;r&rsquo; in it again. I promised to copy them
      all out, and added that I had spent the whole night in amending the
      present part. &ldquo;The whole night! Come and take your reward, for you are
      cleverer than any sorcerer. We must have the author to dinner, and I shall
      make him promise to write all my parts without the &lsquo;r&rsquo;, or the duke will
      not employ him. Indeed, I don&rsquo;t wonder the duke has made you his
      secretary. I never thought it would be possible to do what you have done;
      but I suppose it was very difficult?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. If I were a pretty woman with the like defect I should take
      care to avoid all words with an &lsquo;r&rsquo; in them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that would be too much trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us bet again, for a box or a kiss, that you can spend a whole day
      without using an &lsquo;r&rsquo;. Let us begin now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All in good time,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but we won&rsquo;t have any stake, as I think you
      are too greedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The author came to dinner, and was duly attacked by Madame Vestri. She
      began by saying that it was an author&rsquo;s duty to be polite to actresses,
      and if any of them spoke with a lisp the least he could do was to write
      their parts without the fatal letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young author laughed, and said it could not be done without spoiling
      the style. Thereupon Madame Vestri gave him my version of her part,
      telling him to read it, and to say on his conscience whether the style had
      suffered. He had to confess that my alterations were positive
      improvements, due to the great richness of the French language. And he was
      right, for there is no language in the world that can compare in
      copiousness of expression with the French.
    </p>
    <p>
      This trifling subject kept us merry, but Madame Vestri expressed a devout
      wish that all authors would do for her what I had done. At Paris, where I
      heard her playing well and lisping terribly, she did not find the authors
      so obliging, but she pleased the people. She asked me if I would undertake
      to recompose Zaire, leaving out the r&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;considering that it would have to be in verse, and in
      Voltairean verse, I would rather not undertake the task.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a view to pleasing the actress the young author asked me how I would
      tell her that she was charming without using an &lsquo;r&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say that she enchanted me, made me in an ecstasy, that she is
      unique.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wrote me a letter, which I still keep, in which the &lsquo;r&rsquo; does not
      appear. If I could have stayed at Stuttgart, this device of mine might
      have won me her favours; but after a week of feasting and triumph the
      courier came one morning at ten o&rsquo;clock and announced that his highness,
      the duke, would arrive at four.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I heard the news I told Baletti with the utmost coolness that I
      thought it would be only polite to meet my lord, and swell his train on
      his entry into Louisburg; and as I wished to meet him at a distance of two
      stages I should have to go at once. He thought my idea an excellent one,
      and went to order post-horses immediately; but when he saw me packing up
      all my belongings into my trunk, he guessed the truth and applauded the
      jest. I embraced him and confessed my hardihood. He was sorry to lose me,
      but he laughed when he thought of the feelings of the duke and of the
      three officers when they found out the trick. He promised to write to me
      at Mannheim, where I had decided on spending a week to see my beloved
      Algardi, who was in the service of the Elector. I had also letters for M.
      de Sickirigen and Baron Becker, one of the Elector&rsquo;s ministers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the horses were put in I embraced Baletti, his little girl, and his
      pretty housekeeper, and ordered the postillion to drive to Mannheim.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we reached Mannheim I heard that the Court was at Schwetzingen, and I
      bade the postillion drive on. I found everyone I had expected to see.
      Algardi had got married, M. de Sickingen was soliciting the position of
      ambassador to Paris, and Baron Becker introduced me to the Elector. Five
      or six days after my arrival died Prince Frederic des Deux Ponts, and I
      will here relate an anecdote I heard the day before he died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Algardi had attended on the prince during his last illness. I was
      supping with Veraci, the poet-laureate, on the eve of the prince&rsquo;s death,
      and in the course of supper Algardi came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is the prince?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor prince&mdash;he cannot possibly live more than twenty-four
      hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he still hopes. He grieved me to the heart by bidding me tell him the
      whole truth; he even bade me give my word of honour that I was speaking
      the truth. Then he asked me if he were positively in danger of death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you told him the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. I told him his sickness was undoubtedly a mortal one, but
      that with the help of nature and art wonders might be worked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you deceived him, and told a lie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not deceive him; his recovery comes under the category of the
      possible. I did not want to leave him in despair, for despair would most
      certainly kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; but you will confess that you told him a lie and broke your
      word of honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told no lie, for I know that he may possibly be cured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you lied just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, for he will die to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me that your reasoning is a little Jesuitical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not. My duty was to prolong my patient&rsquo;s life and to spare him
      a sentence which would most certainly have shortened it, possibly by
      several hours; besides, it is not an absolute impossibility that he should
      recover, therefore I did not lie when I told him that he might recover,
      nor did I lie just now when I gave it as my opinion (the result of my
      experience) that he would die to-morrow. I would certainly wager a million
      to one that he will die to-morrow, but I would not wager my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, and yet for all that you deceived the poor man; for his
      intention in asking you the question was not to be told a commonplace
      which he knew as well as you, but to learn your true opinion as to his
      life or death. But again I agree with you that as his physician you were
      quite right not to shorten his few remaining hours by telling him the
      terrible truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a fortnight I left Schwetzingen, leaving some of my belongings under
      the care of Veraci the poet, telling him I would call for them some day;
      but I never came, and after a lapse of thirty-one years Veraci keeps them
      still. He was one of the strangest poets I have ever met. He affected
      eccentricity to make himself notorious, and opposed the great Metastasio
      in everything, writing unwieldy verses which he said gave more scope for
      the person who set them to music. He had got this extravagant notion from
      Jumelli.
    </p>
    <p>
      I traveled to Mayence and thence I sailed to Cologne, where I looked
      forward to the pleasure of meeting with the burgomaster&rsquo;s wife who
      disliked General Kettler, and had treated me so well seven years ago. But
      that was not the only reason which impelled me to visit that odious town.
      When I was at Dresden I had read in a number of the Cologne Gazette that
      &ldquo;Master Casanova has returned to Warsaw only to be sent about his business
      again. The king has heard some stories of this famous adventurer, which
      compel him to forbid him his Court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not stomach language of this kind, and I resolved to pay Jacquet,
      the editor, a visit, and now my time had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made a hasty dinner and then called on the burgomaster, whom I found
      sitting at table with his fair Mimi. They welcomed me warmly, and for two
      hours I told them the story of my adventures during the last seven years.
      Mimi had to go out, and I was asked to dine with them the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought she looked prettier than ever, and my imagination promised me
      some delicious moments with her. I spent an anxious and impatient night,
      and called on my Amphitryon at an early hour to have an opportunity of
      speaking to his dear companion. I found her alone, and began with an
      ardent caress which she gently repelled, but her face froze my passion in
      its course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time is an excellent doctor,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and it has cured me of a passion
      which left behind it the sting of remorse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! The confessional . . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should only serve as a place wherein to confess our sins of the past, and
      to implore grace to sin no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May the Lord save me from repentance, the only source of which is a
      prejudice! I shall leave Cologne to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not tell you to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is no hope, it is no place for me. May I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was delightful at table, but I was gloomy and distracted. At seven
      o&rsquo;clock next day I set out, and as soon as I had passed the Aix la
      Chapelle Gate, I told the postillion to stop and wait for me. I then
      walked to Jacquet&rsquo;s, armed with a pistol and a cane, though I only meant
      to beat him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant shewed me into the room where he was working by himself. It
      was on the ground floor, and the door was open for coolness&rsquo; sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard me coming in and asked what he could do for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You scoundrelly journalist.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I am the adventurer Casanova
      whom you slandered in your miserable sheet four months ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying I directed my pistol at his head, with my left hand, and lifted
      my cane with my right. But the wretched scribbler fell on his knees before
      me with clasped hands and offered to shew me the signed letter he had
      received from Warsaw, which contained the statements he had inserted in
      his paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is this letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have it in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made way for him to search, but I locked and bolted the door to prevent
      his escaping. The man trembled like a leaf and began to look for the
      letter amongst his Warsaw correspondence, which was in a disgraceful state
      of confusion. I shewed him the date of the article in the paper, but the
      letter could not be found; and at the end of an hour he fell down again on
      his knees, and told me to do what I would to him. I gave him a kick and
      told him to get up and follow me. He made no reply, and followed me
      bareheaded till he saw me get into my chaise and drive off, and I have no
      doubt he gave thanks to God for his light escape. In the evening, I
      reached Aix-la-Chapelle, where I found Princess Lubomirska, General
      Roniker, several other distinguished Poles, Tomatis and his wife, and many
      Englishmen of my acquaintance.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     My Stay at Spa&mdash;The Blow&mdash;The Sword&mdash;Della Croce&mdash;Charlotte;
     Her Lying-in and Death&mdash;A Lettre de Cachet Obliges Me to
     Leave Paris in the Course of Twenty-four Hours
</pre>
    <p>
      All my friends seemed delighted to see me, and I was well pleased to find
      myself in such good company. People were on the point of leaving Aix for
      Spa. Nearly everyone went, and those who stayed only did so because
      lodgings were not to be had at Spa. Everybody assured me that this was the
      case, and many had returned after seeking in vain for a mere garret. I
      paid no attention to all this, and told the princess that if she would
      come with me I would find some lodging, were it only in my carriage. We
      accordingly set out the next day, and got to Spa in good time, our company
      consisting of the princess, the prothonotary, Roniker, and the Tomatis.
      Everyone except myself had taken rooms in advance, I alone knew not where
      to turn. I got out and prepared for the search, but before going along the
      streets I went into a shop and bought a hat, having lost mine on the way.
      I explained my situation to the shopwoman, who seemed to take an interest
      in me, and began speaking to her husband in Flemish or Walloon, and
      finally informed me that if it were only for a few days she and her
      husband would sleep in the shop and give up their room to me. But she said
      that she had absolutely no room whatever for my man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the better. Send away your carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall I send it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see that it is housed safely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much am I to pay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing; and if you are not too particular, we should like you to share
      our meals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept your offer thankfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went up a narrow staircase, and found myself in a pretty little room
      with a closet, a good bed, suitable furniture, and everything perfectly
      neat and clean. I thought myself very lucky, and asked the good people why
      they would not sleep in the closet rather than the shop, and they replied
      with one breath that they would be in my way, while their niece would not
      interfere with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      This news about the niece was a surprise to me. The closet had no door,
      and was not much bigger than the bed which it contained; it was, in fact,
      a mere alcove, without any window.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must note that my hostess and her husband, both of them from Liege, were
      perfect models of ugliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not within the limits of possibility,&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;for the
      niece to be uglier than they, but if they allow her to sleep thus in the
      same room with the first comer, she must be proof against all temptation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, I gave no sign, and did not ask to see the niece for fear of
      offense, and I went out without opening my trunk. I told them as I went
      out that I should not be back till after supper, and gave them some money
      to buy wax candles and night lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to see the princess with whom I was to sup. All the company
      congratulated me on my good fortune in finding a lodging. I went to the
      concert, to the bank at faro, and to the other gaming saloons, and there I
      saw the so-called Marquis d&rsquo;Aragon, who was playing at piquet with an old
      count of the Holy Roman Empire. I was told about the duel he had had three
      weeks before with a Frenchman who had picked a quarrel with him; the
      Frenchman had been wounded in the chest, and was still ill. Nevertheless,
      he was only waiting for his cure to be completed to have his revenge,
      which he had demanded as he was taken off the field. Such is the way of
      the French when a duel is fought for a trifling matter. They stop at the
      first blood, and fight the duel over and over again. In Italy, on the
      other hand, duels are fought to the death. Our blood burns to fire when
      our adversary&rsquo;s sword opens a vein. Thus stabbing is common in Italy and
      rare in France; while duels are common in France, and rare in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the company at Spa, I was most pleased to see the Marquis
      Caraccioli, whom I had left in London. His Court had given him leave of
      absence, and he was spending it at Spa. He was brimful of wit and the milk
      of human kindness, compassionate for the weaknesses of others, and devoted
      to youth, no matter of what sex, but he knew well the virtue of
      moderation, and used all things without abusing them. He never played, but
      he loved a good gamester and despised all dupes. The worthy marquis was
      the means of making the fortune of the so-called Marquis d&rsquo;Aragon by
      becoming surety for his nobility and bona fides to a wealthy English widow
      of fifty, who had taken a fancy to him, and brought him her fortune of
      sixty thousand pounds sterling. No doubt the widow was taken with the
      gigantic form and the beautiful title of d&rsquo;Aragon, for Dragon (as his name
      really was) was devoid of wit and manners, and his legs, which I suppose
      he kept well covered, bore disgusting marks of the libertine life he had
      led. I saw the marquis some time afterwards at Marseilles, and a few years
      later he purchased two estates at Modena. His wife died in due course, and
      according to the English law he inherited the whole of her property.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned to my lodging in good time, and went to bed without seeing the
      niece, who was fast asleep. I was waited on by the ugly aunt, who begged
      me not to take a servant while I remained in her house, for by her account
      all servants were thieves.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I awoke in the morning the niece had got up and gone down. I dressed
      to go to the Wells, and warned my host and hostess that I should have the
      pleasure of dining with them. The room I occupied was the only place in
      which they could take their meals, and I was astonished when they came and
      asked my permission to do so. The niece had gone out, so I had to put my
      curiosity aside. When I was out my acquaintances pointed out to me the
      chief beauties who then haunted the Wells. The number of adventurers who
      flock to Spa during the season is something incredible, and they all hope
      to make their fortunes; and, as may be supposed, most of them go away as
      naked as they came, if not more so. Money circulates with great freedom,
      but principally amongst the gamesters, shop-keepers, money-lenders, and
      courtezans. The money which proceeds from the gaming-table has three
      issues: the first and smallest share goes to the Prince-Bishop of Liege;
      the second and larger portion, to the numerous amateur cheats who frequent
      the place; and by far the largest of all to the coffers of twelve
      sharpers, who keep the tables and are authorized by the sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus goes the money. It comes from the pockets of the dupes&mdash;poor
      moths who burn their wings at Spa!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Wells are a mere pretext for gaming, intriguing, and fortune-hunting.
      There are a few honest people who go for amusement, and a few for rest and
      relaxation after the toils of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Living is cheap enough at Spa. The table d&rsquo;hote is excellent, and only
      costs a small French crown, and one can get good lodging for the like sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came home at noon having won a score of louis. I went into the shop,
      intending to go to my room, but I was stopped short by seeing a handsome
      brunette, of nineteen or twenty, with great black eyes, voluptuous lips,
      and shining teeth, measuring out ribbon on the counter. This, then, was
      the niece, whom I had imagined as so ugly. I concealed my surprise and sat
      down in the shop to gaze at her and endeavour to make her acquaintance.
      But she hardly seemed to see me, and only acknowledged my presence by a
      slight inclination of the head. Her aunt came down to say that dinner was
      ready, and I went upstairs and found the table laid for four. The servant
      brought in the soup, and then asked me very plainly to give her some money
      if I wanted any wine, as her master and mistress only drank beer. I was
      delighted with her freedom, and gave her money to buy two bottles of
      Burgundy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master came up and shewed me a gold repeater with a chain also of gold
      by a well-known modern maker. He wanted to know how much it was worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty louis at the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman wants me to give him twenty louis for it, on the condition
      that I return it to-morrow if he brings me twenty-two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I advise you to accept his offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will lend it you with pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave him the twenty Louis, and placed the watch in my jewel-casket. At
      table the niece sat opposite to me, but I took care not to look at her,
      and she, like a modest girl, did not say a score of words all through the
      meal. The meal was an excellent one, consisting of soup, boiled beef, an
      entree, and a roast. The mistress of the house told me that the roast was
      in my honour, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we are not rich people, and we only allow
      ourselves this luxury on a Sunday.&rdquo; I admired her delicacy, and the
      evident sincerity with which she spoke. I begged my entertainers to help
      me with my wine, and they accepted the offer, saying they only wished they
      were rich enough to be able to drink half a bottle a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought trade was good with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stuff is not ours, and we have debts; besides, the expenses are very
      great. We have sold very little up to now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you only sell hats?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we have silk handkerchiefs, Paris stockings, and lace ruffs, but they
      say everything is too dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will buy some things for you, and will send all my friends here. Leave
      it to me; I will see what I can do for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, fetch down one or two packets of those handkerchiefs and some
      stockings, large size, for the gentleman has a big leg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mercy, as the niece was called, obeyed. I pronounced the handkerchiefs
      superb and the stockings excellent. I bought a dozen, and I promised them
      that they should sell out their whole stock. They overwhelmed me with
      thanks, and promised to put themselves entirely in my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      After coffee, which, like the roast, was in my honour, the aunt told her
      niece to take care not to awake me in the morning when she got up. She said
      she would not fail, but I begged her not to take too much trouble over me,
      as I was a very heavy sleeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon I went to an armourer&rsquo;s to buy a brace of pistols, and
      asked the man if he knew the tradesman with whom I was staying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are cousins-german,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he rich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in debts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he is unfortunate, like most honest people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about his wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her careful economy keeps him above water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the niece?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; she&rsquo;s a good girl, but very pious. Her silly scruples keep customers
      away from the shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think she should do to attract customers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She should be more polite, and not play the prude when anyone wants to
      give her a kiss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is like that, is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try her yourself and you will see. Last week she gave an officer a box on
      the ear. My cousin scolded her, and she wanted to go back to Liege;
      however, the wife soothed her again. She is pretty enough, don&rsquo;t you think
      so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I do, but if she is as cross-grained as you say, the best thing
      will be to leave her alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After what I had heard I made up my mind to change my room, for Mercy had
      pleased me in such a way that I was sure I should be obliged to pay her a
      call before long, and I detested Pamelas as heartily as Charpillons.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon I took Rzewuski and Roniker to the shop, and they bought
      fifty ducats&rsquo; worth of goods to oblige me. The next day the princess and
      Madame Tomatis bought all the handkerchiefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came home at ten o&rsquo;clock, and found Mercy in bed as I had done the night
      before. Next morning the watch was redeemed, and the hatter returned me
      twenty-two louis. I made him a present of the two louis, and said I should
      always be glad to lend him money in that way&mdash;the profits to be his.
      He left me full of gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was asked to dine with Madame Tomatis, so I told my hosts that I would
      have the pleasure of supping with them, the costs to be borne by me. The
      supper was good and the Burgundy excellent, but Mercy refused to taste it.
      She happened to leave the room for a moment at the close of the meal, and
      I observed to the aunt that her niece was charming, but it was a pity she
      was so sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will have to change her ways, or I will keep her no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she the same with all men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she has never been in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says she has not, but I don&rsquo;t believe her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder she can sleep so comfortably with a man at a few feet distant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mercy came in, bade us good night, and said she would go to bed. I made as
      if I would give her a kiss, but she turned her back on me, and placed a
      chair in front of her closet so that I might not see her taking off her
      chemise. My host and hostess then went to bed, and so did I, puzzling my
      head over the girl&rsquo;s behaviour which struck me as most extraordinary and
      unaccountable. However, I slept peacefully, and when I awoke the bird had
      left the nest. I felt inclined to have a little quiet argument with the
      girl, and to see what I could make of her; but I saw no chance of my
      getting an opportunity. The hatter availed himself of my offer of purse to
      lend money on pledges, whereby he made a good profit. There was no risk
      for me in the matter, and he and his wife declared that they blessed the
      day on which I had come to live with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fifth or sixth day I awoke before Mercy, and only putting on my
      dressing-gown I came towards her bed. She had a quick ear and woke up, and
      no sooner did she see me coming towards her than she asked me what I
      wanted. I sat down on her bed and said gently that I only wanted to wish
      her a good day and to have a little talk. It was hot weather, and she was
      only covered by a single sheet; and stretching out one arm I drew her
      towards me, and begged her to let me give her a kiss. Her resistance made
      me angry; and passing an audacious hand under the sheet I discovered that
      she was made like other women; but just as my hand was on the spot, I
      received a fisticuff on the nose that made me see a thousand stars, and
      quite extinguished the fire of my concupiscence. The blood streamed from
      my nose and stained the bed of the furious Mercy. I kept my presence of
      mind and left her on the spot, as the blow she had given me was but a
      sample of what I might expect if I attempted reprisals. I washed my face
      in cold water, and as I was doing so Mercy dressed herself and left the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last my blood ceased to flow, and I saw to my great annoyance that my
      nose was swollen in such a manner that my face was simply hideous. I
      covered it up with a handkerchief and sent for the hairdresser to do my
      hair, and when this was done my landlady brought me up some fine trout, of
      which I approved; but as I was giving her the money she saw my face and
      uttered a cry of horror. I told her the whole story, freely acknowledging
      that I was in the wrong, and begging her to say nothing to her niece. Then
      heeding not her excuses I went out with my handkerchief before my face,
      and visited a house which the Duchess of Richmond had left the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half of the suite she had abandoned had been taken in advance by an
      Italian marquis; I took the other half, hired a servant, and had my
      effects transported there from my old lodgings. The tears and
      supplications of my landlady had no effect whatever upon me, I felt I
      could not bear the sight of Mercy any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the house into which I had moved I found an Englishman who said he
      would bring down the bruise in one hour, and make the discoloration of the
      flesh disappear in twenty-four. I let him do what he liked and he kept his
      word. He rubbed the place with spirits of wine and some drug which is
      unknown to me; but being ashamed to appear in public in the state I was
      in, I kept indoors for the rest of the day. At noon the distressed aunt
      brought me my trout, and said that Mercy was cut to the heart to have used
      me so, and that if I would come back I could do what I liked with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must feel,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;that if I complied with your request the
      adventure would become public to the damage of my honour and your
      business, and your niece would not be able to pass for a devotee any
      longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made some reflections on the blow she had given the officer, much to the
      aunt&rsquo;s surprise, for she could not think how I had heard of it; and I
      shewed her that, after having exposed me to her niece&rsquo;s brutality, her
      request was extremely out of place. I concluded by saying that I could
      believe her to be an accomplice in the fact without any great stretch of
      imagination. This made her burst into tears, and I had to apologize and to
      promise to continue forwarding her business by way of consolation, and so
      she left me in a calmer mood. Half an hour afterwards her husband came
      with twenty-five Louis I had lent him on a gold snuff-box set with
      diamonds, and proposed that I should lend two hundred Louis on a ring
      worth four hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be yours,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if the owner does not bring me two hundred
      and twenty Louis in a week&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had the money and proceeded to examine the stone which seemed to be a
      good diamond, and would probably weigh six carats as the owner declared.
      The setting was in gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consent to give the sum required if the owner is ready to give me a
      receipt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do so myself in the presence of witnesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. You shall have the money in the course of an hour; I am going
      to have the stone taken out first. That will make no difference to the
      owner, as I shall have it reset at my own expense. If he redeems it, the
      twenty Louis shall be yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must ask him whether he has any objection to the stone being taken
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, but you can tell him that if he will not allow it to be done
      he will get nothing for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned before long with a jeweller who said he would guarantee the
      stone to be at least two grains over the six carats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you weighed it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I am quite sure it weighs over six carats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you can lend the money on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot command such a sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me why the owner objects to the stone being taken out and
      put in at my expense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t; but he does object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he may take his ring somewhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went away, leaving me well pleased at my refusal, for it was plain
      that the stone was either false or had a false bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent the rest of the day in writing letters and making a good supper,
      In the morning I was awoke by someone knocking at my door, and on my
      getting up to open it, what was my astonishment to find Mercy!
    </p>
    <p>
      I let her in, and went back to bed, and asked her what she wanted with me
      so early in the morning. She sat down on the bed, and began to overwhelm
      me with apologies. I replied by asking her why, if it was her principle to
      fly at her lovers like a tiger, she had slept almost in the same room as
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In sleeping in the closet,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I obeyed my aunt&rsquo;s orders, and in
      striking you (for which I am very sorry) I was but defending my honour;
      and I cannot admit that every man who sees me is at liberty to lose his
      reason. I think you will allow that your duty is to respect, and mine to
      defend, my honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is your line of argument, I acknowledge that you are right; but
      you had nothing to complain of, for I bore your blow in silence, and by my
      leaving the house you might know that it was my intention to respect you
      for the future. Did you come to hear me say this? If so, you are
      satisfied. But you will not be offended if I laugh at your excuses, for
      after what you have said I cannot help thinking them very laughable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you only did your duty in flattening my nose. If so, do you think it
      is necessary to apologize for the performance of duty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have defended myself more gently. But forget everything and
      forgive me; I will defend myself no more in any way. I am yours and I love
      you, and I am ready to prove my love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not have spoken more plainly, and as she spoke the last words
      she fell on me with her face close to mine, which she bedewed with her
      tears. I was ashamed of such an easy conquest, and I gently withdrew from
      her embrace, telling her to return after the bruise on my face had
      disappeared. She left me deeply mortified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian, who had taken half the suite of rooms, had arrived in the
      course of the night. I asked his name, and was given a card bearing the
      name of The Marquis Don Antonio della Croce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it the Croce I knew?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked what kind of an establishment he had, and was informed that the
      marchioness had a lady&rsquo;s maid, and the marquis a secretary and two
      servants. I longed to see the nobleman in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not long to wait, for as soon as he heard that I was his neighbour,
      he came to see me, and we spent two hours in telling each other our
      adventures since we had parted in Milan. He had heard that I had made the
      fortune of the girl he had abandoned, and in the six years that had
      elapsed he had been travelling all over Europe, engaged in a constant
      strife with fortune. At Paris and Brussels he had made a good deal of
      money, and in the latter town he had fallen in love with a young lady of
      rank, whom her father had shut up in a convent. He had taken her away, and
      she it was whom he called the Marchioness della Croce, now six months with
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made her pass for his wife, because, as he said, he meant to marry her
      eventually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have fifty thousand francs in gold,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and as much again in
      jewellery and various possessions. It is my intention to give suppers here
      and hold a bank, but if I play without correcting the freaks of fortune I
      am sure to lose.&rdquo; He intended going to Warsaw, thinking I would give him
      introductions to all my friends there; but he made a mistake, and I did
      not even introduce him to my Polish friends at Spa. I told him he could
      easily make their acquaintance by himself, and that I would neither make
      nor mar with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I accepted his invitation to dinner for the same day. His secretary, as he
      called him, was merely his confederate. He was a clever Veronese named
      Conti, and his wife was an essential accomplice in Croce&rsquo;s designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon my friend the hatter came again with the ring, followed by the
      owner, who looked like a bravo. They were accompanied by the jeweller and
      another individual. The owner asked me once more to lend him two hundred
      louis on the ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      My proper course would have been to beg to be excused, then I should have
      had no more trouble in the matter; but it was not to be. I wanted to make
      him see that the objection he made to having the stone taken out was an
      insuperable obstacle to my lending him the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the stone is removed,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we shall see what it really is.
      Listen to my proposal: if it weighs twenty-six grains, I will give you,
      not two but three hundred louis, but in its present condition I shall give
      nothing at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no business to doubt my word; you insult me by doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, I have no intentions of the kind. I simply propose a wager to
      you. If the stone be found to weigh twenty-six grains, I shall lose two
      hundred Louis, if it weighs much less you will lose the ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a scandalous proposal; it&rsquo;s as much as to tell me that I am a
      liar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not like the tone with which these words were spoken, and I went up
      to the chest of drawers where I kept my pistols, and bade him go and leave
      me in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then General Roniker came in, and the owner of the ring told him of
      the dispute between us. The general looked at the ring, and said to him,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If anyone were to give me the ring I should not have the stone taken out,
      because one should not look a gift horse in the mouth; but if it came to a
      question of buying or lending I would not give a crown for it, were the
      owner an emperor, before the stone was taken out; and I am very much
      surprised at your refusing to let this be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word the knave made for the door, and the ring remained in the
      hands of my late host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you give him his ring?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have advanced him fifty Louis on it; but if he does not redeem
      it to-morrow I will have the stone taken out before a judge, and
      afterwards I shall sell it by auction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the man&rsquo;s manners, and I hope you will never bring anyone to
      my rooms again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The affair came to the following conclusion: The impostor did not redeem
      the ring, and the Liege tradesman had the setting removed. The diamond was
      found to be placed on a bed of rock crystal, which formed two-thirds of
      the whole bulk. However, the diamond was worth fifty Louis, and an
      Englishman bought it. A week afterwards the knave met me as I was walking
      by myself, and begged me to follow him to place where we should be free
      from observation, as his sword had somewhat to say to mine. Curiously
      enough I happened to be wearing my sword at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not follow you,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;the matter can be settled here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are observed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the better. Make haste and draw your sword first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The advantage is with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, and so it ought to be. If you do not draw I will proclaim you
      to be the coward I am sure you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this he drew his sword rapidly and came on, but I was ready to receive
      him. He began to fence to try my mettle, but I lunged right at his chest,
      and gave him three inches of cold steel. I should have killed him on the
      spot if he had not lowered his sword, saying he would take his revenge at
      another time. With this he went off, holding his hand to the wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      A score of people were close by, but no one troubled himself about the
      wounded man, as he was known to have been the aggressor. The duel had no
      further consequences for me. When I left Spa the man was still in the
      surgeon&rsquo;s hands. He was something worse than an adventurer, and all the
      French at Spa disowned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return to Croce and his dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness, his wife so-called, was a young lady of sixteen or
      seventeen, fair-complexioned and tall, with all the manners of the Belgian
      nobility. The history of her escape is well known to her brothers and
      sisters, and as her family are still in existence my readers will be
      obliged to me for concealing her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband had told her about me, and she received me in the most
      gracious manner possible. She shewed no signs of sadness or of repentance
      for the steps she had taken. She was with child for some months, and
      seemed to be near her term, owing to the slimness of her figure.
      Nevertheless she had the aspect of perfect health. Her countenance
      expressed candour and frankness of disposition in a remarkable degree. Her
      eyes were large and blue, her complexion a roseate hue, her small sweet
      mouth, her perfect teeth made her a beauty worthy of the brush of Albano.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought myself skilled in physiognomy, and concluded that she was not
      only perfectly happy, but also the cause of happiness. But here let me say
      how vain a thing it is for anyone to pronounce a man or woman to be happy
      or unhappy from a merely cursory inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young marchioness had beautiful ear-rings, and two rings, which gave
      me a pretext for admiring the beauty of her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conti&rsquo;s wife did not cut any figure at all, and I was all eyes for the
      marchioness, whose name was Charlotte. I was profoundly impressed by her
      that I was quite abstracted during dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sought in vain to discover by what merits Croce had been able to seduce
      two such superior women. He was not a fine-looking man, he was not well
      educated, his manners were doubtful, and his way of speaking by no means
      seductive; in fine, I saw nothing captivating about him, and yet I could
      be a witness to his having made two girls leave their homes to follow him.
      I lost myself in conjecture; but I had no premonition of what was to
      happen in the course of a few weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      When dinner was over I took Croce apart, and talked seriously to him. I
      impressed on him the necessity of circumspect conduct, as in my opinion he
      would be for ever infamous if the beautiful woman whom he had seduced was
      to become wretched by his fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the future I mean to trust to my skill in play, and thus I am sure of
      a comfortable living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she know that your revenue is fed solely by the purses of dupes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows that I am a gamester; and as she adores me, her will is as
      mine. I am thinking of marrying her at Warsaw before she is confined. If
      you are in any want of money, look upon my purse as your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him, and once more pressed on him the duty of exercising extreme
      prudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, I had no need of money. I had played with moderation,
      and my profits amounted to nearly four hundred louis. When the luck turned
      against me I was wise enough to turn my back on the board. Although the
      bruise that Mercy had given me was still apparent, I escorted the
      marchioness to the tables, and there she drew all eyes upon her. She was
      fond of piquet, and we played together for small stakes for some time. In
      the end she lost twenty crowns to me, and I was forced to take the money
      for fear of offending her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we went back we met Croce and Conti, who had both won&mdash;Conti a
      score of louis at Faro, and Croce more than a hundred guineas at &lsquo;passe
      dix&rsquo;, which he had been playing at a club of Englishmen. I was more lively
      at supper than dinner, and excited Charlotte to laughter by my wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henceforth the Poles and the Tomatis only saw me at intervals. I was in
      love with the fair marchioness, and everybody said it was very natural.
      When a week had elapsed, Croce, finding that the pigeons would not come to
      be plucked, despite the suppers he gave, went to the public room, and lost
      continually. He was as used to loss as to gain, and his spirits were
      unaltered; he was still gay, still ate well and drank better, and caressed
      his victim, who had no suspicions of what was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I loved her, but did not dare to reveal my passion, fearing lest it should
      be unrequited; and I was afraid to tell her of Croce&rsquo;s losses lest she
      should put down my action to some ulterior motive; in fine, I was afraid
      to lose the trust she had already begun to place in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of three weeks Conti, who had played with prudence and success,
      left Croce and set out for Verona with his wife and servant. A few days
      later Charlotte dismissed her maid, sending her back to Liege, her native
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the middle of September all the Polish party left the Spa for
      Paris, where I promised to rejoin them. I only stayed for Charlotte&rsquo;s
      sake; I foresaw a catastrophe, and I would not abandon her. Every day
      Croce lost heavily, and at last he was obliged to sell his jewellery. Then
      came Charlotte&rsquo;s turn; she had to give up her watches, ear-rings, her
      rings, and all the jewels she had. He lost everything, but this wonderful
      girl was as affectionate as ever. To make a finish he despoiled her of her
      lace and her best gowns, and then selling his own wardrobe he went to his
      last fight with fortune, provided with two hundred Louis. He played like a
      madman, without common-sense or prudence, and lost all.
    </p>
    <p>
      His pockets were empty, and seeing me he beckoned to me, and I followed
      him out of the Spa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I have two alternatives, I can kill myself this
      instant or I can fly without returning to the house. I shall embrace the
      latter and go to Warsaw on foot, and I leave my wife in your hands, for I
      know you adore her. It must be your task to give her the dreadful news of
      the pass to which I have come. Have a care of her, she is too good by far
      for a poor wretch like me. Take her to Paris and I will write to you there
      at your brother&rsquo;s address. I know you have money, but I would die rather
      than accept a single louis from you. I have still two or three pieces
      left, and I assure you that I am richer at the present moment than I was
      two months ago. Farewell; once more I commend Charlotte to your care; I
      would that she had never known me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words he shed tears, and embracing me went his way. I was
      stupefied at what lay before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to inform a pregnant woman that the man she dearly loved had
      deserted her. The only thought that supported me in that moment was that
      it would be done for love of her, and I felt thankful that I had
      sufficient means to secure her from privation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to the house and told her that we might dine at once, as the
      marquis would be engaged till the evening. She sighed, wished him luck,
      and we proceeded to dine. I disguised my emotions so well that she
      conceived no suspicion. After the meal was over, I asked her to walk with
      me in the garden of the Capuchin Monastery, which was close at hand. To
      prepare her for the fatal news I asked her if she would approve of her
      lover exposing himself to assassination for the sake of bidding adieu to
      her rather than making his escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should blame him for doing so,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;He ought to escape by all
      means, if only to save his life for my sake. Has my husband done so? Speak
      openly to me. My spirit is strong enough to resist even so fatal a blow,
      for I know I have a friend in you. Speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will tell you all. But first of all remember this; you must look
      upon me as a tender father who will never let you want, so long as life
      remains to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case I cannot be called unfortunate, for I have a true friend.
      Say on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told all that Croce had told me, not omitting his last words: &ldquo;I commend
      Charlotte to your care; I would that she had never known me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes she remained motionless, as one turned into stone. By
      her attitude, by her laboured and unequal breath, I could divine somewhat
      of the battle between love, and anger, and sorrow, and pity, that was
      raging in the noble breast. I was cut to the heart. At last she wiped away
      the big tears that began to trickle down her cheeks, and turning to me
      sighed and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear friend, since I can count on you, I am far indeed from utter
      misery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear to you, Charlotte, that I will never leave you till I place you
      again in your husband&rsquo;s hands, provided I do not die before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is enough. I swear eternal gratitude, and to be as submissive to you
      as a good daughter ought to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The religion and philosophy with which her heart and mind were fortified,
      though she made no parade of either, began to calm her spirit, and she
      proceeded to make some reflections on Croce&rsquo;s unhappy lot, but all in pity
      not in anger, excusing his inveterate passion for play. She had often
      heard from Croce&rsquo;s lips the story of the Marseilles girl whom he had left
      penniless in an inn at Milan, commending her to my care. She thought it
      something wonderful that I should again be intervening as the tutelary
      genius; but her situation was much the worse, for she was with child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another difference,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;for I made the fortune of the
      first by finding her an honest husband, whereas I should never have the
      courage to adopt the same method with the second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While Croce lives I am no man&rsquo;s wife but his, nevertheless I am glad to
      find myself free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we were back in the house, I advised her to send away the servant and
      to pay his journey to Besanion, where she had taken him. Thus all
      unpleasantness would be avoided. I made her sell all that remained of her
      poor lover&rsquo;s wardrobe, as also his carriage, for mine was a better one.
      She shewed me all she had left, which only amounted to some sets of linen
      and three or four dresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      We remained at Spa without going out of doors. She could see that my love
      was a tenderer passion than the love of a father, and she told me so, and
      that she was obliged to me for the respect with which I treated her. We
      sat together for hours, she folded in my arms, whilst I gently kissed her
      beautiful eyes, and asked no more. I was happy in her gratitude and in my
      powers of self-restraint. When temptation was too strong I left the
      beautiful girl till I was myself again, and such conquests made me proud.
      In the affection between us there was somewhat of the purity of a man&rsquo;s
      first love.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted a small travelling cap, and the servant of the house went to my
      former lodging to order one. Mercy brought several for me to choose from.
      She blushed when she saw me, but I said nothing to her. When she had gone
      I told Charlotte the whole story, and she laughed with all her heart when
      I reminded her of the bruise on my face when we first met, and informed
      her that Mercy had given it me. She praised my firmness in rejecting her
      repentance, and agreed with me in thinking that the whole plan had been
      concerted between her and her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      We left Spa without any servant, and when we reached Liege we took the way
      of the Ardennes, as she was afraid of being recognized if we passed
      through Brussels. At Luxemburg we engaged a servant, who attended on us
      till we reached Paris. All the way Charlotte was tender and affectionate,
      but her condition prescribed limits to her love, and I could only look
      forward to the time after her delivery. We got down at Paris at the &ldquo;Hotel
      Montmorenci,&rdquo; in the street of the same name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paris struck me quite as a new place. Madame d&rsquo;Urfe was dead, my friends
      had changed their houses and their fortunes; the poor had become rich and
      the rich poor, new streets and buildings were rising on all sides; I
      hardly knew my way about the town. Everything was dearer; poverty was
      rampant, and luxury at it highest pitch. Perhaps Paris is the only city
      where so great a change could take place in the course of five or six
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first call I made was on Madame du Rumain, who was delighted to see
      me. I repaid her the money she had so kindly lent me in the time of my
      distress. She was well in health, but harassed by so many anxieties and
      private troubles that she said Providence must have sent me to her to
      relieve her of all her griefs by my cabala. I told her that I would wait
      on her at any hour or hours; and this, indeed, was the least I could do
      for the woman who had been so kind to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My brother had gone to live in the Faubourg St. Antoine. Both he and his
      wife (who remained constant to him, despite his physical disability) were
      overjoyed to see me, and entreated me to come and stop with them. I told
      them I should be glad to do so, as soon as the lady who had travelled with
      me had got over her confinement. I did not think proper to tell them her
      story, and they had the delicacy to refrain from questioning me on the
      subject. The same day I called on Princess Lubomirska and Tomatis, begging
      them not to take it amiss if my visits were few and far between, as the
      lady they had seen at Spa was approaching her confinement, and demanded
      all my care.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the discharge of these duties I remained constantly by Charlotte&rsquo;s
      side. On October 8th I thought it would be well to take her to Madame
      Lamarre, a midwife, who lived in the Faubourg St. Denis, and Charlotte was
      of the same opinion. We went together, she saw the room, the bed, and
      heard how she would be tended and looked after, for all of which I would
      pay. At nightfall we drove to the place, with a trunk containing all her
      effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we were leaving the Rue Montmorenci our carriage was obliged to stop to
      allow the funeral of some rich man to go by. Charlotte covered her face
      with her handkerchief, and whispered in my ear, &ldquo;Dearest, I know it is a
      foolish superstition, but to a woman in my condition such a meeting is of
      evil omen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Charlotte! I thought you were too wise to have such silly fears. A
      woman in child-bed is not a sick woman, and no woman ever died of giving
      birth to a child except some other disease intervened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear philosopher, it is like a duel; there are two men in perfect
      health, when all of a sudden there comes a sword-thrust, and one of them
      is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a witty idea. But bid all gloomy thoughts go by, and after your
      child is born, and we have placed it in good hands, you shall come with me
      to Madrid, and there I hope to see you happy and contented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the way I did my best to cheer her, for I knew only too well the fatal
      effects of melancholy on a pregnant woman, especially in such a delicate
      girl as Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I saw her completely settled I returned to the hotel, and the next
      day I took up my quarters with my brother. However, as long as my
      Charlotte lived, I only slept at his house, for from nine in the morning
      till after midnight I was with my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      On October 13th Charlotte was attacked with a fever which never left her.
      On the 17th she was happily delivered of a boy, which was immediately
      taken to the church and baptized at the express wishes of the mother.
      Charlotte wrote down what its name was to be&mdash;Jacques (after me),
      Charles (after her), son of Antonio della Croce and of Charlotte de (she
      gave her real name). When it was brought from the church she told Madame
      Lamarre to carry it to the Foundling Hospital, with the certificate of
      baptism in its linen. I vainly endeavoured to persuade her to leave the
      care of the child to me. She said that if it lived the father could easily
      reclaim it. On the same day, October 18th, the midwife gave me the
      following certificate, which I still possess:
    </p>
    <p>
      It was worded as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We, J. B. Dorival, Councillor to the King, Commissary of the Chatelet,
      formerly Superintendent of Police in the City of Paris, do certify that
      there has been taken to the Hospital for Children a male infant, appearing
      to be one day old, brought from the Faubourg St. Denis by the midwife
      Lamarre, and bearing a certificate of baptism to the effect that its name
      is Jacques Charles, son of Antonio della Croce and of Charlotte de&mdash;&mdash;.
      Wherefore, we have delivered the above certificate at our office in the
      City of Paris, this 18th day of October, in the year of our Lord, 1767, at
      seven o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <center>
      &ldquo;DORIVAL.&rdquo;
     </center>
    <p>
      If any of my readers have any curiosity to know the real name of the
      mother, I have given them the means of satisfying it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this I did not leave the bed of the invalid for a single instant. In
      spite of all the doctor&rsquo;s care the fever increased, and at five o&rsquo;clock in
      the morning of October 26th, she succumbed to it. An hour before she
      sighed her last, she bade me the last farewell in the presence of the
      venerable ecclesiastic who had confessed her at midnight. The tears which
      gather fast as I write these words are probably the last honours I shall
      pay to this poor victim of a man who is still alive, and whose destiny
      seemed to be to make women unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat weeping by the bed of her I loved so dearly, and in vain Madame
      Lamarre tried to induce me to come and sit with her. I loved the poor
      corpse better than all the world outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon my brother and his wife came to see me; they had not seen me for a
      week, and were getting anxious. They saw the body lovely in death; they
      understood my tears, and mingled theirs with mine. At last I asked them to
      leave me, and I remained all night by Charlotte&rsquo;s bed, resolved not to
      leave it till her body had been consigned to the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day before this morning of unhappy memory my brother had given me
      several letters, but I had not opened any of them. On my return from the
      funeral I proceeded to do so, and the first one was from M. Dandolo,
      announcing the death of M. de Bragadin; but I could not weep. For
      twenty-two years M. de Bragadin had been as a father to me, living poorly,
      and even going into debt that I might have enough. He could not leave me
      anything, as his property was entailed, while his furniture and his
      library would become the prey of his creditors. His two friends, who were
      my friends also, were poor, and could give me nothing but their love. The
      dreadful news was accompanied by a bill of exchange for a thousand crowns,
      which he had sent me twenty-four hours before his death, foreseeing that
      it would be the last gift he would ever make me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was overwhelmed, and thought that Fortune had done her worst to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent three days in my brother&rsquo;s house without going out. On the fourth
      I began to pay an assiduous court to Princess Lubomirska, who had written
      the king, her brother, a letter that must have mortified him, as she
      proved beyond a doubt that the tales he had listened to against me were
      mere calumny. But your kings do not allow so small a thing to vex or
      mortify them. Besides, Stanislas Augustus had just received a dreadful
      insult from Russia. Repnin&rsquo;s violence in kidnapping the three senators who
      had spoken their minds at the Diet was a blow which must have pierced the
      hapless king to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess had left Warsaw more from hatred than love; though such was
      not the general opinion. As I had decided to visit the Court of Madrid
      before going to Portugal, the princess gave me a letter of introduction to
      the powerful Count of Aranda; and the Marquis Caraccioli, who was still at
      Paris, gave me three letters, one for Prince de la Catolica, the
      Neapolitan ambassador at Madrid, one for the Duke of Lossada, the king&rsquo;s
      favourite and lord high steward, and a third for the Marquis Mora
      Pignatelli.
    </p>
    <p>
      On November 4th I went to a concert with a ticket that the princess had
      given me. When the concert was half-way through I heard my name
      pronounced, accompanied by scornful laughter. I turned round and saw the
      gentleman who was speaking contemptuously of me. It was a tall young man
      sitting between two men advanced in years. I stared him in the face, but
      he turned his head away and continued his impertinencies, saying, amongst
      other things, that I had robbed him of a million francs at least by my
      swindling his late aunt, the Marchioness d&rsquo;Urfe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an impudent liar,&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;and if we were out of this
      room I would give you a kick to teach you to speak respectfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words I made my way out of the hall, and on turning my head
      round I saw that the two elderly men were keeping the young blockhead
      back. I got into my carriage and waited some time, and as he did not come
      I drove to the theatre and chanced to find myself in the same box as
      Madame Valville. She informed me that she had left the boards, and was
      kept by the Marquis the Brunel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you, and wish you good luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will come to supper at my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be only too happy, but unfortunately I have an engagement; but I
      will come and see you if you will give me your address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, I slipped into her hand a rouleau, it being the fifty louis I
      owed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money you lent me so kindly at Konigsberg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is neither the time nor the place to return it. I will only take it
      at my own house, so please do not insist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I put the money back into my pocket, she gave me her address, and I left
      her. I felt too sad to visit her alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later, as I was at table with my brother, my sister-in-law, and
      some young Russians whom he was teaching to paint, I was told that a
      Chevalier of St. Louis wanted to speak to me in the antechamber. I went
      out, and he handed me a paper without making any preface. I opened the
      document, and found it was signed &ldquo;Louis.&rdquo; The great king ordered me to
      leave Paris in twenty-four hours and his realm of France within three
      weeks, and the reason assigned was: &ldquo;It is our good pleasure.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     My Departure From Paris&mdash;My Journey to Madrid&mdash;The Count of
     Aranda&mdash;The Prince de la Catolica&mdash;The Duke of Lossada&mdash;
     Mengs&mdash;A Ball&mdash;Madame Pichona&mdash;Donna Ignazia
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, chevalier,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I have read the little note, and I will try
      and oblige his majesty as soon as possible. However, if I have not time to
      get away in twenty-four hours, his majesty must work his dread will on
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, the twenty-four hours are a mere formality. Subscribe the
      order and give me a receipt for the lettre de cachet, and you can go at
      your convenience. All I ask of you is that you give me your word of honour
      not to go to the theatres or public places of amusement on foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you my word with pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took the chevalier to my room and gave him the necessary acknowledgment,
      and with the observation that he would be glad to see my brother, whom he
      knew already, I led him into the dining-room, and explained with a
      cheerful face the purport of his visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      My brother laughed and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, M. Buhot, this news is like March in Lent, it was quite unnecessary;
      my brother was going in the course of a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the better. If the minister had been aware of that he would not have
      troubled himself about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the reason known?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard something about a proposal to kick a gentleman, who though
      young, is too exalted a person to be spoken to in such a manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, chevalier,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the phrase is a mere formality like the
      twenty-four hours for if the impudent young rascal had come out he would
      have met me, and his sword should have been sufficient to ward off any
      kicks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I then told the whole story, and Buhot agreed that I was in the right
      throughout; adding that the police were also in the right to prevent any
      encounter between us. He advised me to go next morning and tell the tale
      to M. de Sartine, who knew me, and would be glad to have the account from
      my own lips. I said nothing, as I knew the famous superintendent of police
      to be a dreadful sermoniser.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lettre de cachet was dated November 6th, and I did not leave Paris
      till the 20th.
    </p>
    <p>
      I informed all my friends of the great honour his majesty had done me, and
      I would not hear of Madame du Rumain appealing to the king on my behalf,
      though she said she felt certain she could get the order revoked. The Duc
      de Choiseul gave me a posting passport dated November 19th, which I still
      preserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left Paris without any servant, still grieving, though quietly, over
      Charlotte&rsquo;s fate. I had a hundred Louis in cash, and a bill of exchange on
      Bordeaux for eight thousand francs. I enjoyed perfect health, and almost
      felt as if I had been rejuvenated. I had need of the utmost prudence and
      discretion for the future. The deaths of M. de Bragadin and Madame d&rsquo;Urfe
      had left me alone in the world, and I was slowly but steadily approaching
      what is called a certain age, when women begin to look on a man with
      coldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I only called on Madame Valville on the eve of my departure: and found her
      in a richly-furnished house, and her casket well filled with diamonds.
      When I proposed to return her the fifty louis, she asked me if I had got a
      thousand; and on learning that I had only five hundred she refused the
      money absolutely and offered me her purse, which I in my turn refused. I
      have not seen the excellent creature since then, but before I left I gave
      her some excellent advice as to the necessity of saving her gains for the
      time of her old age, when her charms would be no more. I hope she has
      profited by my counsel. I bade farewell to my brother and my sister-in-law
      at six o&rsquo;clock in the evening, and got into my chaise in the moonlight,
      intending to travel all night so as to dine next day at Orleans, where I
      wanted to see an old friend. In half an hour I was at Bourg-la-Reine, and
      there I began to fall asleep. At seven in the morning I reached Orleans.

    <p>
      Fair and beloved France, that went so well in those days, despite lettres
      de cachet, despite corvees, despite the people&rsquo;s misery and the king&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;good pleasure,&rdquo; dear France, where art thou now? Thy sovereign is the
      people now, the most brutal and tyrannical sovereign in the world. You
      have no longer to bear the &ldquo;good pleasure&rdquo; of the sovereign, but you have
      to endure the whims of the mob and the fancies of the Republic&mdash;the
      ruin of all good Government. A republic presupposes self-denial and a
      virtuous people; it cannot endure long in our selfish and luxurious days.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to see Bodin, a dancer, who had married Madame Joffroy, one of my
      thousand mistresses whom I had loved twenty-two years ago, and had seen
      later at Turin, Paris, and Vienna. These meetings with old friends and
      sweethearts were always a weak or rather a strong point with me. For a
      moment I seemed to be young again, and I fed once more on the delights of
      long ago. Repentance was no part of my composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bodin and his wife (who was rather ugly than old-looking, and had become
      pious to suit her husband&rsquo;s tastes, thus giving to God the devil&rsquo;s
      leavings), Bodin, I say, lived on a small estate he had purchased, and
      attributed all the agricultural misfortunes he met with in the course of
      the year to the wrath of an avenging Deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a fasting dinner with them, for it was Friday, and they strictly
      observed all the rules of the Church. I told them of my adventures of the
      past years, and when I had finished they proceeded to make reflections on
      the faults and failings of men who have not God for a guide. They told me
      what I knew already: that I had an immortal soul, that there was a God
      that judgeth righteously, and that it was high time for me to take example
      by them, and to renounce all the pomps and vanities of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And turn Capuchin, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might do much worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; but I shall wait till my beard grows the necessary length in a
      single night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of their silliness, I was not sorry to have spent six hours with
      these good creatures who seemed sincerely repentant and happy in their
      way, and after an affectionate embrace I took leave of them and travelled
      all night. I stopped at Chanteloup to see the monument of the taste and
      magnificence of the Duc de Choiseul, and spent twenty-four hours there. A
      gentlemanly and polished individual, who did not know me, and for whom I
      had no introduction, lodged me in a fine suite of rooms, gave me supper,
      and would only sit down to table with me after I had used all my powers of
      persuasion. The next day he treated me in the same way, gave me an
      excellent dinner, shewed me everything, and behaved as if I were some
      prince, though he did not even ask my name. His attentions even extended
      to seeing that none of his servants were at hand when I got into my
      carriage and drove off. This was to prevent my giving money to any of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The castle on which the Duc de Choiseul had spent such immense sums had in
      reality cost him nothing. It was all owing, but he did not trouble himself
      about that in the slightest degree, as he was a sworn foe to the principle
      of meum and tuum. He never paid his creditors, and never disturbed his
      debtors. He was a generous man; a lover of art and artists, to whom he
      liked to be of service, and what they did for him he looked upon as a
      grateful offering. He was intellectual, but a hater of all detail and
      minute research, being of a naturally indolent and procrastinating
      disposition. His favourite saying was,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s time enough for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I got to Poitiers, I wanted to push on to Vivonne; it was seven
      o&rsquo;clock in the evening, and two girls endeavoured to dissuade me from this
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very cold,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;and the road is none of the best. You are no
      courier, sup here, we will give you a good bed, and you shall start again
      in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made up my mind to go on, but if you will keep me company at
      supper I will stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would cost you too dearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never too dear. Quick I make up your minds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we will sup with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then lay the table for three; I must go on in an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an hour! You mean three, sir; papa will take two hours to get you a
      good supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will not go on, but you must keep me company all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will do so, if papa does not object. We will have your chaise put into
      the coach-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These two minxes gave me an excellent supper, and were a match for me in
      drinking as well as eating. The wine was delicious, and we stayed at table
      till midnight, laughing and joking together, though without overstepping
      the bounds of propriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      About midnight, the father came in jovially, and asked me how I had
      enjoyed my supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but I have enjoyed still more the company of
      your charming daughters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted to hear it. Whenever you come this way they shall keep you
      company, but now it is past midnight, and time for them to go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded my head, for Charlotte&rsquo;s death was still too fresh in my memory
      to admit of my indulging in any voluptuous pleasures. I wished the girls a
      pleasant sleep, and I do not think I should even have kissed them if the
      father had not urged me to do this honour to their charms. However, my
      vanity made me put some fire into the embrace, and I have no doubt they
      thought me a prey to vain desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was alone I reflected that if I did not forget Charlotte I was a
      lost man. I slept till nine o&rsquo;clock, and I told the servant that came to
      light my fire to get coffee for three, and to have my horses put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two pretty girls came to breakfast with me, and I thanked them for
      having made me stay the night. I asked for the bill, and the eldest said
      it was in round figures a Louis apiece. I shewed no sign of anger at this
      outrageous fleecing, but gave them three Louis with the best grace
      imaginable and went on my way. When I reached Angouleme, where I expected
      to find Noel, the King of Prussia&rsquo;s cook, I only found his father, whose
      talents in the matter of pates was something prodigious. His eloquence was
      as fervent as his ovens. He said he would send his pates all over Europe
      to any address I liked to give him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! To Venice, London, Warsaw, St. Petersburg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Constantinople, if you like. You need only give me your address, and
      you need not pay me till you get the pates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sent his pates to my friends in Venice, Warsaw, and Turin, and everybody
      thanked me for the delicious dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel had made quite a fortune. He assured me he had sent large
      consignments to America, and with the exception of some losses by
      shipwreck all the pates had arrived in excellent condition. They were
      chiefly made of turkeys, partridges, and hare, seasoned with truffles, but
      he also made pates de foie gras of larks and of thrushes, according to the
      season.
    </p>
    <p>
      In two days I arrived at Bordeaux, a beautiful town coming only second to
      Paris, with respect to Lyons be it said. I spent a week there, eating and
      drinking of the best, for the living there is the choicest in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I transferred my bill of exchange for eight thousand francs to a Madrid
      house, and crossed the Landes, passing by Mont de Marsan, Bayonne, and St.
      Jean de Luz, where I sold my post-chaise. From St. Jean de Luz I went to
      Pampeluna by way of the Pyrenees, which I crossed on mule-back, my baggage
      being carried by another mule. The mountains struck me as higher than the
      Alps. In this I may possibly be wrong, but I am certain that the Pyrenees
      are the most picturesque, fertile, and agreeable of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Pampeluna a man named Andrea Capello took charge of me and my luggage,
      and we set out for Madrid. For the first twenty leagues the travelling was
      easy enough, and the roads as good as any in France. These roads did
      honour to the memory of M. de Gages, who had administered Navarre after
      the Italian war, and had, as I was assured, made the road at his own
      expense. Twenty years earlier I had been arrested by this famous general;
      but he had established a claim on posterity greater than any of his
      victories. These laurels were dyed in blood, but the maker of a good road
      is a solid benefactor of all posterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In time this road came to an end, and thenceforth it would be incorrect to
      say that the roads were bad, for, to tell the truth, there were no roads
      at all. There were steep ascents and violent descents, but no traces of
      carriage wheels, and so it is throughout the whole of Old Castile. There
      are no good inns, only miserable dens scarce good enough for the
      muleteers, who make their beds beside their animals. Signor or rather
      Senor Andrea tried to choose the least wretched inns for me, and after
      having provided for the mules he would go round the entire village to get
      something for me to eat. The landlord would not stir; he shewed me a room
      where I could sleep if I liked, containing a fire-place, in which I could
      light a fire if I thought fit, but as to procuring firewood or provisions,
      he left that all to me. Wretched Spain!
    </p>
    <p>
      The sum asked for a night&rsquo;s accommodation was less than a farmer would ask
      in France or Germany for leave to sleep in his barn; but there was always
      an extra charge of a &lsquo;pizetta por el ruido&rsquo;. The pizetta is worth four
      reals; about twenty-one French sous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord smoked his paper cigarette nonchalantly enough, blowing
      clouds of smoke into the air with immense dignity. To him poverty was as
      good as riches; his wants were small, and his means sufficed for them. In
      no country in Europe do the lower orders live so contentedly on a very
      little as in Spain. Two ounces of white bread, a handful of roast
      chestnuts or acorns (called bellotas in Spanish) suffice to keep a
      Spaniard for a day. It is his glory to say when a stranger is departing
      from his abode,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not given myself any trouble in waiting on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This proceeds in part from idleness and in part from Castilian pride. A
      Castilian should not lower himself, they say, by attending on a Gavacho,
      by which name the Spaniards know the French, and, indeed, all foreigners.
      It is not so offensive as the Turkish appellation of dog, or the damned
      foreigner of the English. Of course, persons who have travelled or have
      had a liberal education do not speak in this way, and a respectable
      foreigner will find reasonable Spaniards as he will find reasonable Turks
      and Englishmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second night of my journey I slept at Agreda, a small and ugly
      town, or rather village. There Sister Marie d&rsquo;Agreda became so crazy as to
      write a life of the Virgin, which she affirmed to have been dictated to
      her by the Mother of the Lord. The State Inquisitors had given me this
      work to read when I was under the Leads, and it had nearly driven me mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      We did ten Spanish leagues a day, and long and weary leagues they seemed
      to me. One morning I thought I saw a dozen Capuchins walking slowly in
      front of us, but when we caught them up I found they were women of all
      ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they mad?&rdquo; I said to Senior Andrea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. They wear the Capuchin habit out of devotion, and you would
      not find a chemise on one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing surprising in their not having chemises, for the chemise
      is a scarce article in Spain, but the idea of pleasing God by wearing a
      Capuchin&rsquo;s habit struck me as extremely odd. I will here relate an amusing
      adventure which befell me on my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the gate of a town not far from Madrid I was asked for my passport. I
      handed it over, and got down to amuse myself. I found the chief of the
      customs&rsquo; house engaged in an argument with a foreign priest who was on his
      way to Madrid, and had no passport for the capital. He shewed one he had
      had for Bilbao, but the official was not satisfied. The priest was a
      Sicilian, and I asked him why he had exposed himself to being placed in
      this disagreeable predicament. He said he thought it was unnecessary to
      have a passport in Spain when one had once journeyed in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to go to Madrid,&rdquo; said he to me, &ldquo;and hope to obtain a chaplaincy
      in the house of a grandee. I have a letter for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shew it; they will let you pass then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor priest drew out the letter and shewed it to the official, who
      opened it, looked at the signature, and absolutely shrieked when he saw
      the name Squillace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, senor abbe! you are going to Madrid with a letter from Squillace,
      and you dare to shew it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerks, constables, and hangers-on, hearing that the hated Squillace,
      who would have been stoned to death if it had not been for the king&rsquo;s
      protection, was the poor abbe&rsquo;s only patron, began to beat him violently,
      much to the poor Sicilian&rsquo;s astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I interposed, however, and after some trouble I succeeded in rescuing the
      priest, who was then allowed to pass, as I believe, as a set-off against
      the blows he had received.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squillace was sent to Venice as Spanish ambassador, and in Venice he died
      at an advanced age. He was a man designed to be an object of intense
      hatred to the people; he was simply ruthless in his taxation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of my room had a lock on the outside but none on the inside. For
      the first and second night I let it pass, but on the third I told Senor
      Andrea that I must have it altered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Senor Don Jacob, you must bear with it in Spain, for the Holy Inquisition
      must always be at liberty to inspect the rooms of foreigners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what in the devil&rsquo;s name does your cursed Inquisition want . . . ?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the love of God, Senor Jacob, speak not thus! if you were overheard
      we should both be undone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what can the Holy Inquisition want to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything. It wants to know whether you eat meat on fast days, whether
      persons of opposite sexes sleep together, if so, whether they are married,
      and if not married it will cause both parties to be imprisoned; in fine,
      Senor Don Jaime, the Holy inquisition is continually watching over our
      souls in this country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we met a priest bearing the viaticum to some sick man, Senor Andrea
      would tell me imperatively to get out of my carriage, and then there was
      no choice but to kneel in the mud or dust as the case might be. The chief
      subject of dispute at that time was the fashion of wearing breeches. Those
      who wore &lsquo;braguettes&rsquo; were imprisoned, and all tailors making breeches
      with &lsquo;braguettes&rsquo; were severely punished. Nevertheless, people persisted
      in wearing them, and the priests and monks preached in vain against the
      indecency of such a habit. A revolution seemed imminent, but the matter
      was happily settled without effusion of blood. An edict was published and
      affixed to the doors of all the churches, in which it was declared that
      breeches with braguettes were only to be worn by the public hangmen. Then
      the fashion passed away; for no one cared to pass for the public
      executioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      By little and little I got an insight into the manners of the Spanish
      nation as I passed through Guadalaxara and Alcala, and at length arrived
      at Madrid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guadalaxara, or Guadalajara, is pronounced by the Spaniards with a strong
      aspirate, the x and j having the same force. The vowel d, the queen of
      letters, reigns supreme in Spain; it is a relic of the old Moorish
      language. Everyone knows that the Arabic abounds in d&rsquo;s, and perhaps the
      philologists are right in calling it the most ancient of languages, since
      the a is the most natural and easy to pronounce of all the letters. It
      seems to me very mistaken to call such words as Achald, Ayanda, Almanda,
      Acard, Agracaramba, Alcantara, etc., barbarous, for the sonorous ring with
      which they are pronounced renders the Castilian the richest of all modern
      languages. Spanish is undoubtedly one of the finest, most energetic, and
      most majestic languages in the world. When it is pronounced &lsquo;ore rotundo&rsquo;
      it is susceptible of the most poetic harmony. It would be superior to the
      Italian, if it were not for the three guttural letters, in spite of what
      the Spaniards say to the contrary. It is no good remonstrating with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quisquis amat ranam, ranam purat esse Dianam&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was entering the Gate of Alcala, my luggage was searched, and the
      clerks paid the greatest attention to my books, and they were very
      disappointed only to find the &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; in Greek, and a Latin Horace. They
      were taken away, but three days after, they were returned to me at my
      lodging in the Rue de la Croix where I had gone in spite of Senor Andrea,
      who had wanted to take me elsewhere. A worthy man whom I had met in
      Bordeaux had given me the address. One of the ceremonies I had to undergo
      at the Gate of Alcala displeased me in the highest degree. A clerk asked
      me for a pinch of snuff, so I took out my snuff-box and gave it him, but
      instead of taking a pinch he snatched it out of my hands and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Senor, this snuff will not pass in Spain&rdquo; (it was French rappee); and
      after turning it out on the ground he gave me back the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      The authorities are most rigorous on the matter of this innocent powder,
      and in consequence an immense contraband trade is carried on. The spies
      employed by the Spanish snuff-makers are always on the look-out after
      foreign snuff, and if they detect anyone carrying it they make him pay
      dearly for the luxury. The ambassadors of foreign powers are the only
      persons exempted from the prohibitions. The king who stuffs into his
      enormous nose one enormous pinch as he rises in the morning wills that all
      his subjects buy their snuff of the Spanish manufacturers. When Spanish
      snuff is pure it is very good, but at the time I was in Spain the genuine
      article could hardly be bought for its weight in gold. By reason of the
      natural inclination towards forbidden fruit, the Spaniards are extremely
      fond of foreign snuff, and care little for their own; thus snuff is
      smuggled to an enormous extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      My lodging was comfortable enough, but I felt the want of a fire as the
      cold was more trying than that of Paris, in spite of the southern
      latitude. The cause of this cold is that Madrid is the highest town in
      Europe. From whatever part of the coast one starts, one has to mount to
      reach the capital. The town is also surrounded by mountains and hills, so
      that the slightest touch of wind from the north makes the cold intense.
      The air of Madrid is not healthy for strangers, especially for those of a
      full habit of body; the Spaniards it suits well enough, for they are dry
      and thin, and wear a cloak even in the dog days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men of Spain dwell mentally in a limited horizon, bounded by prejudice
      on every side; but the women, though ignorant, are usually intelligent;
      while both sexes are the prey of desires, as lively as their native air,
      as burning as the sun that shines on them. Every Spaniard hates a
      foreigner, simply because he is a foreigner, but the women avenge us by
      loving us, though with great precautions, for your Spaniard is intensely
      jealous. They watch most jealously over the honour of their wives and
      daughters. As a rule the men are ugly, though there are numerous
      exceptions; while the women are pretty, and beauties are not uncommon. The
      southern blood in their veins inclines them to love, and they are always
      ready to enter into an intrigue and to deceive the spies by whom they are
      surrounded. The lover who runs the greatest dangers is always the
      favourite. In the public walks, the churches, the theatres, the Spanish
      women are always speaking the language of the eyes. If the person to whom
      it is addressed knows how to seize the instant, he may be sure of success,
      but if not, the opportunity will never be offered him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I required some kind of heat in my room, and could not bear a charcoal
      brazier, so I incited an ingenious tin-smith to make me a stove with a
      pipe going out of the window. However, he was so proud of his success that
      he made me pay dearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the stove was ready I was told where I might go and warm myself an
      hour before noon, and stay till dinner-time. It is called La Pueyta del
      Sol, &ldquo;The Gate of the Sun.&rdquo; It is not a gate, but it takes its name from
      the manner in which the source of all heat lavishes his treasures there,
      and warms all who come and bask in his rays. I found a numerous company
      promenading there, walking and talking, but it was not much to my taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted a servant who could speak French, and I had the greatest
      difficulty in getting one, and had to pay dearly, for in Madrid the kind
      of man I wanted was called a page. I could not compel him to mount behind
      my carriage, nor to carry a package, nor to light me by night with a torch
      or lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      My page was a man of thirty, and terribly ugly; but this was a
      recommendation, as his ugliness secured him from the jealous suspicions of
      husbands. A woman of rank will not drive out without one of these pages
      seated in the forepart of her carriage. They are said to be more difficult
      to seduce than the strictest of duennas.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged to take one of these rascally tribe into my service, and I
      wish he had broken his leg on his way to my house.
    </p>
    <p>
      I delivered all my introductions, beginning with the letter from Princess
      Lubomirska to the Count of Aranda. The count had covered himself with
      glory by driving the Jesuits out of Spain. He was more powerful than the
      king himself, and never went out without a number of the royal guardsmen
      about him, whom he made to sit down at his table. Of course all the
      Spaniards hated him, but he did not seem to care much for that. A profound
      politician, and absolutely resolute and firm, he privately indulged in
      every luxury that he forbade to others, and did not care whether people
      talked of it or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a rather ugly man, with a disagreeable squint. His reception of me
      was far from cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want in Spain?&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To add fresh treasures to my store of experience, by observing the
      manners and the customs of the country, and if possible to serve the
      Government with such feeble talents as I may possess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you have no need of my protection. If you do not infringe the laws,
      no one will disturb you. As to your obtaining employment, you had better
      go to the representative of your country; he will introduce you at Court,
      and make you known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, the Venetian ambassador will do nothing for me; I am in disgrace
      with the Government. He will not even receive me at the embassy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I would advise you to give up all hopes of employment, for the king
      would begin by asking your ambassador about you, and his answer would be
      fatal. You will do well to be satisfied with amusing yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this I called on the Neapolitan ambassador, who talked in much the
      same way. Even the Marquis of Moras, one of the most pleasant men in
      Spain, did not hold out any hopes. The Duke of Lossada, the high steward
      and favourite of his Catholic majesty, was sorry to be disabled from doing
      me any service, in spite of his good will, and advised me, in some way or
      other, to get the Venetian ambassador to give me a good word, in spite of
      my disgrace. I determined to follow his advice, and wrote to M. Dandolo,
      begging him to get the ambassador to favour me at the Spanish Court in
      spite of my quarrel with the Venetian Government. I worded my letter in
      such a way that it might be read by the Inquisitors themselves, and
      calculated on its producing a good impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I had written this letter I went to the lodging of the Venetian
      ambassador, and presented myself to the secretary, Gaspar Soderini, a
      worthy and intelligent man. Nevertheless, he dared to tell me that he was
      astonished at my hardihood in presenting myself at the embassy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have presented myself, sir, that my enemies may never reproach me for
      not having done so; I am not aware that I have ever done anything which
      makes me too infamous to call on my ambassador. I should have credited
      myself with much greater hardihood if I had left without fulfilling this
      duty; but I shall be sorry if the ambassador views my proceedings in the
      same light as yourself, and puts down to temerity what was meant for a
      mark of respect. I shall be none the less astonished if his excellency
      refuses to receive me on account of a private quarrel between myself and
      the State Inquisitors, of which he knows no more than I do, and I know
      nothing. You will excuse my saying that he is not the ambassador of the
      State Inquisitors, but of the Republic of which I am a subject; for I defy
      him and I defy the Inquisitors to tell me what crime I have committed that
      I am to be deprived of my rights as a Venetian citizen. I think that,
      while it is my duty to reverence my prince in the person of my ambassador,
      it is his duty to afford me his protection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech had made Soderini blush, and he replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you write a letter to the ambassador, with the arguments you
      have just used to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not write to him before I know whether he will receive me or not.
      But now, as I have reason to suppose that his opinions are much the same
      as your own, I will certainly write to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know whether his excellency thinks as I do or not, and, in spite
      of what I said to you, it is just possible that you do not know my own
      opinions on the question; but write to him, and he may possibly give you
      an audience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall follow your advice, for which I am much obliged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I got home I wrote to his excellency all I had said to the secretary,
      and the next day I had a visit from Count Manucci. The count proved to be
      a fine-looking young man of an agreeable presence. He said that he lived
      in the embassy, that his excellency had read my letter, and though he
      grieved not to receive me publicly he should be delighted to see me in
      private, for he both knew and esteemed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Manucci told me that he was a Venetian, and that he knew me by name,
      as he often heard his father and mother lamenting my fortune. Before long
      it dawned upon me that this Count Manucci was the son of that Jean
      Baptiste Manucci who had served as the spy of the State Inquisitors and
      had so adroitly managed to get possession of my books of magic, which were
      in all probability the chief corpus delicti.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not say anything to him, but I was certain that my guess was
      correct. His mother was the daughter of a valet de chambre, and his father
      was a poor mechanic. I asked the young man if he were called count at the
      embassy, and he said he bore the title in virtue of a warrant from the
      elector-palatine. My question shewed him that I knew his origin, and he
      began to speak openly to me; and knowing that I was acquainted with the
      peculiar tastes of M. de Mocenigo, the ambassador, he informed me
      laughingly that he was his pathic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do my best for you,&rdquo; he added; and I was glad to hear him say so,
      for an Alexis should be able to obtain almost anything from his Corydon.
      We embraced, and he told me as we parted that he would expect me at the
      embassy in the afternoon, to take coffee in his room; the ambassador, he
      said, would certainly come in as soon as he heard of my presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to the embassy, and had a very kind reception from the ambassador,
      who said he was deeply grieved not to be able to receive me publicly. He
      admitted that he might present me at Court without compromising himself,
      but he was afraid of making enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope soon to receive a letter from a friend of mine, which will
      authorise your excellency producing me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted, in that case, to present you to all the Spanish
      ministers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This Mocenigo was the same that acquired such a reputation at Paris by his
      leanings to pederasty, a vice or taste which the French hold in horror.
      Later on, Mocenigo was condemned by the Council of Ten to ten years&rsquo;
      imprisonment for having started on an embassy to Vienna without formal
      permission. Maria Theresa had intimated to the Venetian Government that
      she would not receive such a character, as his habits would be the scandal
      of her capital. The Venetian Government had some trouble with Mocenigo,
      and as he attempted to set out for Vienna they exiled him and chose
      another ambassador, whose morals were as bad, save that the new ambassador
      indulged himself with Hebe and not Ganymede, which threw a veil of decency
      over his proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his reputation for pederasty, Mocenigo was much liked at
      Madrid. On one occasion I was at a ball, and a Spaniard noticing me with
      Manucci, came up to me, and told me with an air of mystery that that young
      man was the ambassador&rsquo;s wife. He did not know that the ambassador was
      Manucci&rsquo;s wife; in fact, he did not understand the arrangement at all.
      &ldquo;Where ignorance is bliss!&rdquo; etc. However, in spite of the revolting nature
      of this vice, it has been a favourite one with several great men. It was
      well-known to the Ancients, and those who indulged in it were called
      Hermaphrodites, which symbolises not a man of two sexes but a man with the
      passions of the two sexes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had called two or three times on the painter Mengs, who had been painter
      in ordinary to his Catholic majesty for six years, and had an excellent
      salary. He gave me some good dinners. His wife and family were at Rome,
      while he basked in the royal favours at Madrid, enjoying the unusual
      privilege of being able to speak to the king whenever he would. At Mengs&rsquo;s
      house I made the acquaintance of the architect Sabatini, an extremely
      able man whom the king had summoned from Naples to cleanse Madrid, which
      was formerly the dirtiest and most stinking town in Europe, or, for the
      matter of that, in the world. Sabatini had become a rich man by
      constructing drains, sewers, and closets for a city of fourteen thousand
      houses. He had married by proxy the daughter of Vanvitelli, who was also
      an architect at Naples, but he had never seen her. She came to Madrid
      about the same time as myself. She was a beauty of eighteen, and no sooner
      did she see her husband than she declared she would never be his wife.
      Sabatini was neither a young man nor a handsome one, but he was
      kind-hearted and distinguished; and when he told his young wife that she
      would have to choose between him and a nunnery, she determined to make the
      best of what she thought a bad bargain. However, she had no reason to
      repent of her choice; her husband was rich, affectionate, and easygoing,
      and gave her everything she wanted. I sighed and burned for her in
      silence, not daring to declare my love, for while the wound of the death
      of Charlotte was still bleeding I also began to find that women were
      beginning to give me the cold shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of amusing myself I began to go to the theatre, and the masked
      balls to which the Count of Aranda had established. They were held in a
      room built for the purpose, and named &lsquo;Los Scannos del Peral&rsquo;. A Spanish
      play is full of absurdities, but I rather relished the representations.
      The &lsquo;Autos Sacramentales&rsquo; were still represented; they were afterwards
      prohibited. I could not help remarking the strange way in which the boxes
      are constructed by order of the wretched police. Instead of being boarded
      in front they are perfectly open, being kept up by small pillars. A
      devotee once said to me at the theatre that this was a very wise
      regulation, and he was surprised that it was not carried into force in
      Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because lovers, who feel sure that no one in the pit can see them, may
      commit improprieties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I only answered with a shrug of the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a large box opposite to the stage sat &lsquo;los padres&rsquo; of the Holy
      Inquisition to watch over the morals of actors and audience. I was gazing
      on them when of a sudden the sentinel at the door of the pit called out
      &ldquo;Dios!&rdquo; and at this cry all the actors and all the audience, men and
      women, fell down on their knees, and remained kneeling till the sound of a
      bell in the street ceased to be heard. This bell betokened that a priest
      was passing by carrying the viaticum to some sick man. I felt very much
      inclined to laugh, but I had seen enough of Spanish manners to refrain.
      All the religion of the Spaniard is in outward show and ceremony. A
      profligate woman before yielding to the desires of her lover covers the
      picture of Christ, or the Virgin, with a veil. If the lover laughed at
      this absurdity he would run a risk of being denounced as an Atheist, and
      most probably by the wretched woman who had sold him her charms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Madrid, and possibly all over Spain, a gentleman who takes a lady to a
      private room in an inn must expect to have a servant in the room the whole
      of the time, that he may be able to swear that the couple took no indecent
      liberties with each other. In spite of all, profligacy is rampant at
      Madrid, and also the most dreadful hypocrisy, which is more offensive to
      true piety than open sin. Men and women seemed to have come to an
      agreement to set the whole system of surveillance utterly at nought.
      However, commerce with women is not without its dangers; whether it be
      endemic or a result of dirty habits, one has often good reason to repent
      the favours one has obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The masked ball quite captivated me. The first time I went to see what it
      was like and it only cost me a doubloon (about eleven francs), but ever
      after it cost me four doubloons, for the following reason:
    </p>
    <p>
      An elderly gentleman, who sat next me at supper, guessed I was a foreigner
      by my difficulty in making myself understood by the waiter, and asked me
      where I had left my lady friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not got one; I came by myself to enjoy this delightful and
      excellently-managed entertainment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but you ought to come with a companion; then you could dance. At
      present you cannot do so, as every lady has her partner, who will not
      allow her to dance with anyone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must be content not to dance, for, being a stranger, I do not know
      any lady whom I can ask to come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a stranger you would have much less difficulty in securing a partner
      than a citizen of Madrid. Under the new fashion, introduced by the Count
      of Aranda, the masked ball has become the rage of all the women in the
      capital. You see there are about two hundred of them on the floor
      to-night; well, I think there are at least four thousand girls in Madrid
      who are sighing for someone to take them to the ball, for, as you may
      know, no woman is allowed to come by herself. You would only have to go to
      any respectable people, give your name and address, and ask to have the
      pleasure of taking their daughter to the ball. You would have to send her
      a domino, mask, and gloves; and you would take her and bring her back in
      your carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if the father and mother refused?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you would make your bow and go, leaving them to repent of their
      folly, for the girl would sigh, and weep, and moan, bewail parental
      tyranny, call Heaven to witness the innocency of going to a ball, and
      finally go into convulsions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This oration, which was uttered in the most persuasive style, made me
      quite gay, for I scented an intrigue from afar. I thanked the masked (who
      spoke Italian very well) and promised to follow his advice and to let him
      know the results.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted to hear of your success, and you will find me in the
      box, where I shall be glad if you will follow me now, to be introduced to
      the lady who is my constant companion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was astonished at so much politeness, and told him my name and followed
      him. He took me into a box where there were two ladies and an elderly man.
      They were talking about the ball, so I put in a remark or two on the same
      topic, which seemed to meet with approval. One of the two ladies, who
      retained some traces of her former beauty, asked me, in excellent French,
      what circles I moved in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only been a short time in Madrid, and not having been presented at
      Court I really know no one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really! I quite pity you. Come and see me, you will be welcome. My name
      is Pichona, and anybody will tell you where I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted to pay my respects to you, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What I liked best about the spectacle was a wonderful and fantastic dance
      which was struck up at midnight. It was the famous fandango, of which I
      had often heard, but of which I had absolutely no idea. I had seen it
      danced on the stage in France and Italy, but the actors were careful not
      to use those voluptuous gestures which make it the most seductive in the
      world. It cannot be described. Each couple only dances three steps, but
      the gestures and the attitudes are the most lascivious imaginable.
      Everything is represented, from the sigh of desire to the final ecstasy;
      it is a very history of love. I could not conceive a woman refusing her
      partner anything after this dance, for it seemed made to stir up the
      senses. I was so excited at this Bacchanalian spectacle that I burst out
      into cries of delight. The masker who had taken me to his box told me that
      I should see the fandango danced by the Gitanas with good partners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I remarked, &ldquo;does not the Inquisition object to this dance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Pichona told me that it was absolutely forbidden, and would not be
      danced unless the Count of Aranda had given permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard afterwards that, on the count forbidding the fandango, the
      ball-room was deserted with bitter complaints, and on the prohibition
      being withdrawn everyone was loud in his praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I told my infamous page to get me a Spaniard who would teach
      me the fandango. He brought me an actor, who also gave me Spanish lessons,
      for he pronounced the language admirably. In the course of three days the
      young actor taught me all the steps so well that, by the confession of the
      Spaniards themselves, I danced it to perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next ball I determined to carry the masker&rsquo;s advice into effect,
      but I did not want to take a courtezan or a married woman with me, and I
      could not reasonably expect that any young lady of family would accompany
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was St. Anthony&rsquo;s Day, and passing the Church of the Soledad I went in,
      with the double motive of hearing mass and of procuring a partner for the
      next day&rsquo;s ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      I noticed a fine-looking girl coming out of the confessional, with
      contrite face and lowered eyes, and I noted where she went. She knelt down
      in the middle of the church, and I was so attracted by her appearance that
      I registered a mental vow to the effect that she should be my first
      partner. She did not look like a person of condition, nor, so far as I
      could see, was she rich, and nothing about her indicated the courtezan,
      though women of that class go to confession in Madrid like everybody else.
      When mass was ended, the priest distributed the Eucharist, and I saw her
      rise and approach humbly to the holy table, and there receive the
      communion. She then returned to the church to finish her devotions, and I
      was patient enough to wait till they were over.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she left, in company with another girl, and I followed her at a
      distance. At the end of a street her companion left her to go into her
      house, and she, retracing her steps, turned into another street and
      entered a small house, one story high. I noted the house and the street
      (Calle des Desinjano) and then walked up and down for half an hour, that I
      might not be suspected of following her. At last I took courage and walked
      in, and, on my ringing a bell, I heard a voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest folk,&rdquo; I answered, according to the custom of the country; and the
      door was opened. I found myself in the presence of a man, a woman, the
      young devotee I had followed, and another girl, somewhat ugly.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Spanish was bad, but still it was good enough to express my meaning,
      and, hat in hand, I informed the father that, being a stranger, and having
      no partner to take to the ball, I had come to ask him to give me his
      daughter for my partner, supposing he had a daughter. I assured him that I
      was a man of honour, and that the girl should be returned to him after the
      ball in the same condition as when she started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Senor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is my daughter, but I don&rsquo;t know you, and I don&rsquo;t
      know whether she wants to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to go, if my parents will allow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know this gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never seen him, and I suppose he has never seen me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak the truth, senora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father asked me my name and address, and promised I should have a
      decisive answer by dinner-time, if I dined at home. I begged him to excuse
      the liberty I had taken, and to let me know his answer without fail, so
      that I might have time to get another partner if it were unfavourable to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as I was beginning to dine my man appeared. I asked him to sit down,
      and he informed me that his daughter would accept my offer, but that her
      mother would accompany her and sleep in the carriage. I said that she
      might do so if she liked, but I should be sorry for her on account of the
      cold. &ldquo;She shall have a good cloak,&rdquo; said he; and he proceeded to inform
      me that he was a cordwainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I hope you will take my measure for a pair of shoes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t do that; I&rsquo;m an hidalgo, and if I were to take anyone&rsquo;s measure
      I should have to touch his foot, and that would be a degradation. I am a
      cobbler, and that is not inconsistent with my nobility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, will you mend me these boots?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will make them like new; but I see they want a lot of work; it will
      cost you a pezzo duro, about five francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him that I thought his terms very reasonable, and he went out with
      a profound bow, refusing absolutely to dine with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a cobbler who despised bootmakers because they had to touch the
      foot, and they, no doubt, despised him because he touched old leather.
      Unhappy pride how many forms it assumes, and who is without his own
      peculiar form of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I sent to the gentleman-cobbler&rsquo;s a tradesman with dominos,
      masks, and gloves; but I took care not to go myself nor to send my page,
      for whom I had an aversion which almost amounted to a presentiment. I
      hired a carriage to seat four, and at nightfall I drove to the house of my
      pious partner, who was quite ready for me. The happy flush on her face was
      a sufficient index to me of the feelings of her heart. We got into the
      carriage with the mother, who was wrapped up in a vast cloak, and at the
      door of the dancing-room we descended, leaving the mother in the carriage.
      As soon as we were alone my fair partner told me that her name was Donna
      Ignazia.

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     My Amours With Donna Ignazia&mdash;My Imprisonment At Buen
     Retiro&mdash;My Triumph&mdash;I Am Commended to the Venetian
     Ambassador by One of the State Inquisitors
</pre>
    <p>
      We entered the ball-room and walked round several times. Donna Ignazia was
      in such a state of ecstasy that I felt her trembling, and augured well for
      my amorous projects. Though liberty, nay, license, seemed to reign
      supreme, there was a guard of soldiers ready to arrest the first person
      who created any disturbance. We danced several minuets and square dances,
      and at ten o&rsquo;clock we went into the supper-room, our conversation being
      very limited all the while, she not speaking for fear of encouraging me
      too much, and I on account of my poor knowledge of the Spanish language. I
      left her alone for a moment after supper, and went to the box, where I
      expected to find Madame Pichona, but it was occupied by maskers, who were
      unknown to me, so I rejoined my partner, and we went on dancing the
      minuets and quadrilles till the fandango was announced. I took my place
      with my partner, who danced it admirably, and seemed astonished to find
      herself so well supported by a foreigner. This dance had excited both of
      us, so, after taking her to the buffet and giving her the best wines and
      liqueurs procurable, I asked her if she were content with me. I added that
      I was so deeply in love with her that unless she found some means of
      making me happy I should undoubtedly die of love. I assured her that I was
      ready to face all hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By making you happy,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I shall make myself happy, too. I
      will write to you to-morrow, and you will find the letter sewn into the
      hood of my domino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find me ready to do anything, fair Ignazia, if you will give me
      hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last the ball was over, and we went out and got into the carriage. The
      mother woke up, and the coachman drove off, and I, taking the girl&rsquo;s
      hands, would have kissed them. However, she seemed to suspect that I had
      other intentions, and held my hands clasped so tightly that I believe I
      should have found it a hard task to pull them away. In this position Donna
      Ignazia proceeded to tell her mother all about the ball, and the delight
      it had given her. She did not let go my hands till we got to the corner of
      their street, when the mother called out to the coachman to stop, not
      wishing to give her neighbours occasion for slander by stopping in front
      of their own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I sent for the domino, and in it I found a letter from Donna
      Ignazia, in which she told me that a Don Francisco de Ramos would call on
      me, that he was her lover, and that he would inform me how to render her
      and myself happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Francisco wasted no time, for the next morning at eight o&rsquo;clock my
      page sent in his name. He told me that Donna Ignazia, with whom he spoke
      every night, she being at her window and he in the street, had informed
      him that she and I had been at the ball together. She had also told him
      that she felt sure I had conceived a fatherly affection for her, and she
      had consequently prevailed upon him to call on me, being certain that I
      would treat him as my own son. She had encouraged him to ask me to lend
      him a hundred doubloons which would enable them to get married before the
      end of the carnival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am employed at the Mint,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;but my present salary is a very
      small one. I hope I shall get an increase before long, and then I shall be
      in a position to make Ignazia happy. All my relations live at Toledo, and
      I have no friends at Madrid, so when we set up our only friends will be
      the father and mother of my wife and yourself, for I am sure you love her
      like a daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have probed my heart to its core,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but just now I am
      awaiting remittances, and have very little money about me. You may count
      on my discretion, and I shall be delighted to see you whenever you care to
      call on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gallant made me a bow, and took his departure in no good humour. Don
      Francisco was a young man of twenty-two, ugly and ill-made. I resolved to
      nip the intrigue in the bud, for my inclination for Donna Ignazia was of
      the lightest description; and I went to call on Madame Pichona, who had
      given me such a polite invitation to come and see her. I had made
      enquiries about her, and had found out that she was an actress and had
      been made rich by the Duke of Medina-Celi. The duke had paid her a visit
      in very cold weather, and finding her without a fire, as she was too poor
      to buy coals, had sent her the next day a silver stove, which he had
      filled with a hundred thousand pezzos duros in gold, amounting to three
      hundred thousand francs in French money. Since then Madame Pichona lived
      at her ease and received good company.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave me a warm reception when I called on her, but her looks were sad.
      I began by saying that as I had not found her in her box on the last ball
      night I had ventured to come to enquire after her health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not go,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;for on that day died my only friend the Duke of
      Medina-Celi. He was ill for three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sympathise with you. Was the duke an old man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly sixty. You have seen him; he did not look his age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have I seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he not bring you to my box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so! He did not tell me his name and I never saw him
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was grieved to hear of his death; it was in all probability a misfortune
      for me as well as Madame Pichona. All the duke&rsquo;s estate passed to a son of
      miserly disposition, who in his turn had a son who was beginning to evince
      the utmost extravagance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was told that the family of Medina-Celi enjoys thirty titles of
      nobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day a young man called on me to offer me, as a foreigner, his services
      in a country which he knew thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Count Marazzini de Plaisance,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I am not rich and I have
      come to Madrid to try and make my fortune. I hope to enter the bodyguard
      of his Catholic majesty. I have been indulging in the amusements of the
      town ever since I came. I saw you at the ball with an unknown beauty. I
      don&rsquo;t ask you to tell me her name, but if you are fond of novelty I can
      introduce you to all the handsomest girls in Madrid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If my experience had taught me such wholesome lessons as I might have
      expected, I should have shown the impudent rascal the door. Alas! I began
      to be weary of my experience and the fruits of it; I began to feel the
      horrors of a great void; I had need of some slight passion to wile away
      the dreary hours. I therefore made this Mercury welcome, and told him I
      should be obliged by his presenting me to some beauties, neither too easy
      nor too difficult to access.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me to the ball,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;and I will shew you some women
      worthy of your attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ball was to take place the same evening, and I agreed; he asked me to
      give him some dinner, and I agreed to that also. After dinner he told me
      he had no money, and I was foolish enough to give him a doubloon. The
      fellow, who was ugly, blind of one eye, and full of impudence, shewed me a
      score of pretty women, whose histories he told me, and seeing me to be
      interested in one of them he promised to bring her to a procuress. He kept
      his word, but he cost me dear; for the girl only served for an evening&rsquo;s
      amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of the carnival the noble Don Diego, the father of Donna
      Ignazia, brought me my boots, and the thanks of his wife and himself for
      the pleasure I had given her at the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is as good as she is beautiful,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;she deserves to prosper,
      and if I have not called on her it is only that I am anxious to do nothing
      which could injure her reputation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her reputation, Senor Caballero, is above all reproach, and I shall be
      delighted to see you whenever you honour me with a call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The carnival draws near to its end,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and if Donna Ignazia
      would like to go to another ball I shall be happy to take her again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must come and ask her yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not fail to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was anxious to see how the pious girl, who had tried to make me pay a
      hundred doubloons for the chance of having her after her marriage, would
      greet me, so I called the same day. I found her with her mother, rosary in
      hand, while her noble father was botching old boots. I laughed inwardly at
      being obliged to give the title of don to a cobbler who would not make
      boots because he was an hidalgo. Hidalgo, meaning noble, is derived from
      &lsquo;higo de albo&rsquo;, son of somebody, and the people, whom the nobles call
      &lsquo;higos de nade&rsquo;, sons of nobody, often revenge themselves by calling the
      nobles hideputas, that is to say, sons of harlots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Ignazia rose politely from the floor, where she was sitting
      cross-legged, after the Moorish fashion. I have seen exalted ladies in
      this position at Madrid, and it is very common in the antechambers of the
      Court and the palace of the Princess of the Asturias. The Spanish women
      sit in church in the same way, and the rapidity with which they can change
      this posture to a kneeling or a standing one is something amazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Ignazia thanked me for honouring her with a visit, adding that she
      would never have gone to the ball if it had not been for me, and that she
      never hoped to go to it again, as I had doubtless found someone else more
      worthy of my attentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not found anyone worthy to be preferred before you,&rdquo; I replied,
      &ldquo;and if you would like to go to the ball again I should be most happy to
      take you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father and mother were delighted with the pleasure I was about to give
      to their beloved daughter. As the ball was to take place the same evening,
      I gave the mother a doubloon to get a mask and domino. She went on her
      errand, and, as Don Diego also went out on some business, I found myself
      alone with the girl. I took the opportunity of telling her that if she
      willed I would be hers, as I adored her, but that I could not sigh for
      long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you ask, and what can I offer, since I must keep myself pure for
      my husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should abandon yourself to me without reserve, and you may be sure
      that I should respect your innocence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I then proceeded to deliver a gentle attack, which she repulsed, with a
      serious face. I stopped directly, telling her that she would find me
      polite and respectful, but not in the least affectionate, for the rest of
      the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face had blushed a vivid scarlet, and she replied that her sense of
      duty obliged her to repulse me in spite of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I liked this metaphysical line of argument. I saw that I had only to
      destroy the idea of duty in her and all the rest would follow. What I had
      to do was to enter into an argument, and to bear away the prize directly I
      saw her at a loss for an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your duty,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;forces you to repulse me in spite of yourself,
      your duty is a burden on you. If it is a burden on you, it is your enemy,
      and if it is your enemy why do you suffer it thus lightly to gain the
      victory? If you were your own friend, you would at once expel this
      insolent enemy from your coasts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may not be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it may. Only shut your eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I immediately laid hands on a tender place; she repulsed me, but more
      gently and not so seriously as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may, of course, seduce me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but if you really love me you
      will spare me the shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Ignazia, there is no shame in a girl giving herself up to the man
      she loves. Love justifies all things. If you do not love me I ask nothing
      of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how shall I convince you that I am actuated by love and not by
      complaisance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me to do what I like, and my self-esteem will help me to believe
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as I cannot be certain that you will believe me, my duty plainly
      points to a refusal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, but you will make me sad and cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall be sad, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these encouraging words I embraced her, and obtained some solid favours
      with one hardy hand. She made no opposition, and I was well pleased with
      what I had got; and for a first attempt I could not well expect more.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture the mother came in with the dominos and gloves. I refused
      to accept the change, and went away to return in my carriage, as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the first step had been taken, and Donna Ignazia felt it would be
      ridiculous not to join in with my conversation at the ball which all
      tended to procuring the pleasure of spending our nights together. She
      found me affectionate all the evening, and at supper I did my best to get
      her everything she liked. I made her see that the part she had at last
      taken was worthy of praise, and not blame. I filled her pockets with
      sweets, and put into my own pockets two bottles of ratafia, which I handed
      over to the mother, who was asleep in the carriage. Donna Ignazia
      gratefully refused the quadruple I wished to give her, saying that if it
      were in my power to make such presents, I might give the money to her
      lover whenever he called on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but what shall I say to prevent his taking
      offence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him that it is on account of what he asked you. He is poor, and I am
      sure he is in despair at not seeing me in the window to-night. I shall
      tell him I only went to the ball with you to please my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Donna Ignazia, a mixture of voluptuousness and piety, like most Spanish
      women, danced the fandango with so much fire that no words could have
      expressed so well the Joys that were in store for me. What a dance it is!
      Her bosom was heaving and her blood all aflame, and yet I was told that
      for the greater part of the company the dance was wholly innocent, and
      devoid of any intention. I pretended to believe it, but I certainly did
      not. Ignazia begged me to come to mass at the Church of the Soledad the
      next day at eight o&rsquo;clock. I had not yet told her that it was there I had
      seen her first. She also asked me to come and see her in the evening, and
      said she would send me a letter if we were not left alone together.
    </p>
    <p>
      I slept till noon, and was awoke by Marazzini, who came to ask me to give
      him some dinner. He told me he had seen me with my fair companion the
      night before, and that he had vainly endeavoured to find out who she was.
      I bore with this singularly misplaced curiosity, but when it came to his
      saying that he would have followed us if he had had any money, I spoke to
      him in a manner that made him turn pale. He begged pardon, and promised to
      bridle his curiosity for the future. He proposed a party of pleasure with
      the famous courtezan Spiletta, whose favours were dear, but I declined,
      for my mind was taken up with the fair Ignazia, whom I considered a worthy
      successor to Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to the church, and she saw me when she came in, followed by the
      same companion as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knelt down at two or three paces from me, but did not once look in my
      direction. Her friend, on the other hand, inspected me closely; she seemed
      about the same age as Ignazia, but she was ugly. I also noticed Don
      Francisco, and as I was going out of the church my rival followed me, and
      congratulated me somewhat bitterly on my good fortune in having taken his
      mistress a second time to the ball. He confessed that he had been on our
      track the whole evening, and that he should have gone away well enough
      pleased if it had not been for the way in which we dance the fandango. I
      felt this was an occasion for a little gentle management, and I answered
      good-humouredly that the love he thought he noticed was wholly imaginary,
      and that he was wrong to entertain any suspicions as to so virtuous a girl
      as Donna Ignazia. At the same time I placed an ounce in his hand, begging
      him to take it on account. He did so with an astonished stare, and,
      calling me his father and guardian angel, swore an eternal gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening I called on Don Diego, where I was regaled with the
      excellent ratafia I had given the mother, and the whole family began to
      speak of the obligations Spain owed to the Count of Aranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No exercise is more healthful than dancing,&rdquo; said Antonia, the mother,
      &ldquo;and before his time balls were strictly forbidden. In spite of that he is
      hated for having expelled &lsquo;los padres de la compagnia de Jesus&rsquo;, and for
      his sumptuary regulations. But the poor bless his name, for all the money
      produced by the balls goes to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thus,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;to go to the ball is to do a pious work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have two cousins,&rdquo; said Ignazia, &ldquo;who are perfect angels of goodness. I
      told them that you had taken me to the ball; but they are so poor that
      they have no hope of going. If you like you can make them quite happy by
      taking them on the last day of the carnival. The ball closes at midnight,
      so as not to profane Ash Wednesday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be happy to oblige you, all the more as your lady mother will not
      be obliged to wait for us in the carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind; but I shall have to introduce you to my aunt; she is
      so particular. When she knows you, I am sure she will consent, for you
      have all the air of discretion. Go and see her to-day; she lives in the
      next street, and over her door you will see a notice that lace is washed
      within. Tell her that my mother gave you the address. To-morrow morning,
      after mass, I will see to everything else, and you must come here at noon
      to agree as to our meeting on the last day of the carnival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did all this, and the next day I heard that it was settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will have the dominos ready at my house,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and you must come in
      at the back door. We will dine in my room, mask, and go to the ball. The
      eldest of your cousins must be disguised as a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell her anything about that, for fear she might think it a sin,
      but once in your house you will have no difficulty in managing her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The younger of the two cousins was ugly, but looked like a woman, where as
      the elder looked like an ugly dressed man in woman&rsquo;s clothes. She made an
      amusing contrast with Donna Ignazia, who looked most seductive when she
      laid aside her air of piety.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took care that everything requisite for our disguises should be at hand
      in a neighbouring closet, unbeknown to my rascally page. I gave him a
      piece of money in the morning, and told him to spend the last day of the
      carnival according to his own taste, as I should not require his services
      till noon the day after.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ordered a good dinner, and a waiter to serve it, at the tavern, and got
      rid of Marazzini by giving him a doubloon. I took great pains over the
      entertainment I was to give the two cousins and the fair Ignazia, whom I
      hoped that day to make my mistress. It was all quite a novelty for me; I
      had to do with three devotees, two hideous and the third ravishingly
      beautiful, who had already had a foretaste of the joys in store for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came at noon, and for an hour I discoursed to them in a moral and
      unctuous manner. I had taken care to provide myself with some excellent
      wine, which did not fail to take effect on the three girls, who were not
      accustomed to a dinner that lasted two hours. They were not exactly
      inebriated, but their spirits were worked up to a pitch they had never
      attained before.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told the elder cousin, who might be twenty-five years old, that I was
      going to disguise her as a man; consternation appeared on her features,
      but I had expected as much, and Donna Ignazia told her she was only too
      lucky, and her sister observed that she did not think it could be a sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were a sin,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do you suppose that I should have suggested
      it to your virtuous sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Donna Ignazia, who knew the Legendarium by heart, corroborated my
      assertion by saying that the blessed St. Marina had passed her whole life
      in man&rsquo;s clothes; and this settled the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then burst into a very high-flown eulogium of her intellectual capacity,
      so as to enlist her vanity in the good cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and do you ladies wait here; I want to enjoy your
      surprise when you see her in man&rsquo;s clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ugly cousin made a supreme effort and followed me, and when she had
      duly inspected her disguise I told her to take off her boots and to put on
      white stockings and shoes, of which I had provided several pairs. I sat
      down before her, and told her that if she suspected me of any
      dishonourable intentions she would commit a mortal sin, as I was old
      enough to be her father. She replied that she was a good Christian, but
      not a fool. I fastened her garters for her, saying that I should never
      have supposed she had so well-shapen and so white a leg, which compliment
      made her smile in a satisfied manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although I had a fine view of her thighs, I observed no traces of a blush
      on her face. I then gave her a pair of my breeches, which fitted her
      admirably, though I was five inches taller than she, but this difference
      was compensated by the posterior proportions, with which, like most women,
      she was bountifully endowed. I turned away to let her put them on in
      freedom, and, having given her a linen shirt, she told me she had finished
      before she had buttoned it at the neck. There may possibly have been a
      little coquetry in this, as I buttoned the shirt for her, and was thus
      gratified with a sight of her splendid breast. I need not say whether she
      was pleased or not at my refraining from complimenting her upon her fine
      proportions. When her toilette was finished I surveyed her from head to
      foot, and pronounced her to be a perfect man, with the exception of one
      blemish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you allow me to arrange your shirt so as to obviate it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be much obliged, as I have never dressed in man&rsquo;s clothes
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I then sat down in front of her, and, after unbuttoning the fly, arranged
      the shirt in a proper manner. In doing so I allowed myself some small
      liberties, but I toyed with such a serious air that she seemed to take it
      all as a matter of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had put on her domino and mask I led her forth, and her sister and
      Donna Ignazia congratulated her on her disguise, saying that anybody would
      take her for a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s your turn,&rdquo; I said to the younger one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go with him,&rdquo; said the elder, &ldquo;Don Jaime is as honest a man as you will
      find in Spain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was really not much to be done to the younger sister, her disguise
      being simply a mask and domino, but as I wanted to keep Ignazia a long
      time I made her put on white stockings, change her kerchief, and a dozen
      other trifles. When she was ready I brought her forth, and Donna Ignazia
      noticing that she had changed her stockings and kerchief, asked her
      whether I were as expert at dressing a lady as at turning a lady into a
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I did everything for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next came the turn of Don Diego&rsquo;s daughter, and as soon as I had her in
      the closet I did my pleasure on her, she submitting with an air that
      seemed to say, &ldquo;I only give in because I can&rsquo;t resist.&rdquo; Wishing to save
      her honour I withdrew in time, but in the second combat I held her for
      half an hour to my arms. However, she was naturally of a passionate
      disposition, and nature had endowed her with a temperament able to resist
      the most vigorous attacks. When decency made us leave the closet, she
      remarked to her cousins,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I should never have done; I had to alter the whole fit of the
      domino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I admired her presence of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nightfall we went to the ball, at which the fandango might be danced ad
      libitum by a special privilege, but the crowd was so great that dancing
      was out of the question. At ten we had supper, and then walked up and
      down, till all at once the two orchestras became silent. We heard the
      church clocks striking midnight the carnival was over, and Lent had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      This rapid transition from wantonness to devotion, from paganism to
      Christianity, has something startling and unnatural about it. At
      fifty-nine minutes past eleven the senses are all aglow; midnight sounds,
      and in a minute they are supposed to be brought low, and the heart to be
      full of humble repentance; it is an absurdity, an impossibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took the three girls to my house to take off their dominos, and we then
      escorted the two cousins home. When we had left them for a few minutes
      Donna Ignazia told me that she would like a little coffee. I understood
      her, and took her to my house, feeling sure of two hours of mutual
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took her to my room, and was just going out to order the coffee when I
      met Don Francisco, who asked me plainly to let him come up, as he had seen
      Donna Ignazia go in with me. I had sufficient strength of mind to conceal
      my rage and disappointment, and told him to come in, adding that his
      mistress would be delighted at this unexpected visit. I went upstairs, and
      he followed me, and I shewed him into the room, congratulating the lady on
      the pleasant surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I expected that she would play her part as well as I had played mine, but
      I was wrong. In her rage she told him that she would never have asked me
      to give her a cup of coffee if she had foreseen this piece of importunity,
      adding that if he had been a gentleman he would have known better than to
      intrude himself at such an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of my own anger I felt that I must take the poor devil&rsquo;s part; he
      looked like a dog with a tin kettle tied to his tail. I tried to calm
      Donna Ignazia, telling her that Don Francisco had seen us by a mere
      accident, and that it was I who had asked him to come upstairs, in the
      hope of pleasing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Ignazia feigned to be persuaded and asked her lover to sit down, but
      she did not speak another word to him, confining her remarks to me, saying
      how much she had enjoyed the ball, and how kind I had been to take her
      cousins.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had taken a cup of coffee, Don Francisco bade us a good night. I
      told him I hoped he would come and see me before Lent was over, but Donna
      Ignazia only vouchsafed him a slight nod. When he had gone she said, sadly
      enough, that she was sorry he had deprived us both of our pleasure, and
      that she was sure Don Francisco was still hanging about the place, and
      that she dared not expose herself to his vengeance. &ldquo;So take me home, but
      if you love me come and see me again. The trick the stupid fellow has
      played me shall cost him dear. Are you sure I don&rsquo;t love him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite certain, for you love me too well to love anybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Donna Ignazia gave me a hasty proof of her affection, and I escorted her
      home, assuring her that she would be the sole object of my thoughts as
      long as I stayed at Madrid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I dined with Mengs, and the day after that I was accosted in
      the street by an ill-looking fellow, who bade me follow him to a cloister,
      as he had something of importance to communicate to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he saw that we were unobserved, he told me that the Alcalde
      Messa was going to pay me a visit that same night with a band of police,
      &ldquo;of whom,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I am one. He knows you have concealed weapons in
      your room. He knows, or thinks he knows, certain other things which
      authorize him to seize your person and to take you to the prison where
      persons destined for the galleys are kept. I give you all this warning
      because I believe you to be a man of honour. Despise not my advice, but
      look to yourself, and get into some place of security.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I credited what he told me, as the circumstance of my having arms was
      perfectly true, so I gave the man a doubloon, and, instead of calling on
      Donna Ignazia, as I intended, I went back to my lodging, and after putting
      the weapons under my cloak I went to Mengs&rsquo;s, leaving word at the cafe to
      send me my page as soon as he came back. In Mengs&rsquo;s house I was safe, as
      it belonged to the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter was an honest fellow, but proud and suspicious in excess. He
      did not refuse me an asylum for the night, but he told me that I must look
      out for some other refuge, as the alcalde must have some other accusation
      against me, and that knowing nothing of the merits or demerits of the case
      he could not take any part in it. He gave me a room and we supped
      together, discussing the matter all the time, I persisting that the
      possession of arms was my only offence, and he replying that if it were so
      I should have awaited the alcalde fearlessly, as it stood to reason that a
      man had a right to keep defensive weapons in his own room. To this I
      answered that I had only come to him to avoid passing the night in prison,
      as I was certain that the man had told me the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow I shall look out for another lodging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I confessed, however, that it would have been wiser of me to leave my
      pistols and musket in my room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and you might have remained there yourself. I did not think you were
      so easily frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we were arguing it over my landlord came and said that the alcalde with
      thirty constables had been to my apartment and had broken open the door.
      He had searched everything, but unsuccessfully, and had gone away after
      sealing the room and its contents. He had arrested and imprisoned my page
      on the charge of having warned me, &ldquo;for otherwise,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Venetian
      gentleman would never have gone to the house of Chevalier Mengs, where he
      is out of my power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Mengs agreed that I had been right in believing my informant&rsquo;s
      tale, and he added that the first thing in the morning I should go and
      protest my innocence before the Count of Aranda, but he especially urged
      on me the duty of defending the poor page. My landlord went his way, and
      we continued the discussion, Mengs insisting on the page&rsquo;s innocence, till
      at last I lost all patience, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My page must be a thorough-paced scoundrel; the magistrate&rsquo;s arresting
      him for warning me is an absolute proof that he knew of my approaching
      arrest. What is a servant who does not warn his master under such
      circumstances but a rascal? Indeed I am absolutely certain that he was the
      informer, for he was the only person who knew where the arms were
      concealed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mengs could find no answer to this, and left to go to bed. I did the same
      and had an excellent night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the next morning the great Mengs sent me linen and all the
      requisites of the toilette. His maid brought me a cup of chocolate, and
      his cook came to ask if I had permission to eat flesh-meat. In such ways a
      prince welcomes a guest, and bids him stay, but such behaviour in a
      private person is equivalent to a hint to go. I expressed my gratitude,
      and only accepted a cup of chocolate and one handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      My carriage was at the door, and I was just taking leave of Mengs when an
      officer appeared on the scene, and asked the painter if the Chevalier de
      Casanova was in his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the Chevalier de Casanova,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I hope you will follow me of your own free will to the prison of
      Buen Retiro. I cannot use force here, for this house is the king&rsquo;s, but I
      warn you that in less than an hour the Chevalier Mengs will have orders to
      turn you out, and then you will be dragged to prison, which would be
      unpleasant for you. I therefore advise you to follow me quietly, and to
      give up such weapons as you may possess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chevalier Mengs will give you the weapons in question. I have carried
      them with me for eleven years; they are meant to protect me on the
      highways. I am ready to follow you, but first allow me to write four
      notes; I shall not be half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can neither allow you to wait nor to write, but you will be at liberty
      to do so after you have reached the prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; then I am ready to follow you, for I have no choice. I shall
      remember Spanish justice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I embraced Mengs, had the weapons put into my carriage, and got in with
      the officer, who seemed a perfect gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took me to the Castle of Buen Retiro, formerly a royal palace, and now
      a prison. When my conductor had consigned me to the officer of the watch I
      was handed over to a corporal, who led me into a vast hall on the ground
      floor of the building. The stench was dreadful, and the prisoners were
      about thirty, ten of them being soldiers. There were ten or twelve large
      beds, some benches, no tables, and no chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked a guard to get me some pens, ink, and paper, and gave him a duro
      for the purpose. He took the coin smilingly, and went away, but he did not
      return. When I asked his brethren what had become of him they laughed in
      my face. But what surprised me the most was the sight of my page and
      Marazzini, who told me in Italian that he had been there for three days,
      and that he had not written to me as he had a presentiment that we should
      soon meet. He added that in a fortnight&rsquo;s time we should be sent off under
      a heavy escort to work in some fortress, though we might send our pleas to
      the Government, and might possibly be let out after three or four years&rsquo;
      imprisonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not to be condemned before I am heard. The alcalde
      will come and interrogate you tomorrow, and your answers will be taken
      down; that&rsquo;s all. You may then be sent to hard labour in Africa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has your case been heard yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were at me about it for three hours yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of questions did they ask you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wished to know what banker furnished me with money for my expenses.
      I told them I had not got a banker, and that I lived by borrowing from my
      friends, in the expectation of becoming one of the king&rsquo;s body-guard. They
      then asked me how it was that the Parmese ambassador knew nothing about
      me, and I replied that I had never been presented to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Without the favour of your ambassador,&rsquo; they objected, &lsquo;you could never
      join the royal guard, and you must be aware of that, but the king&rsquo;s
      majesty shall give you employment where you will stand in need of no
      commendation;&rsquo; and so the alcalde left me. If the Venetian ambassador does
      not interpose in your behalf you will be treated in the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I concealed my rage, and sat down on a bed, which I left after three
      hours, as I found myself covered with the disgusting vermin which seem
      endemic in Spain. The very sight of them made me sick. I stood upright,
      motionless, and silent, devouring the bile which consumed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no good in talking; I must write; but where was I to find
      writing materials? However, I resolved to wait in silence; my time must
      come, sooner or later.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon Marazzini told me that he knew a soldier for whose trustworthiness
      he would answer, and who would get me my dinner if I gave him the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no appetite,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and I am not going to give a farthing to
      anyone till the stolen crown is restored to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made an uproar over this piece of cheating, but the soldiers only
      laughed at him. My page then asked him to intercede with me, as he was
      hungry, and had no money wherewith to buy food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not give him a farthing; he is no longer in my service, and would
      to God I had never seen him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My companions in misery proceeded to dine on bad garlic soup and wretched
      bread, washed down by plain water, two priests and an individual who was
      styled corregidor excepted, and they seemed to fare very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four o&rsquo;clock one of Mengs&rsquo;s servants brought me a dinner which would
      have sufficed for four. He wanted to leave me the dinner and come for the
      plates in the evening; but not caring to share the meal with the vile mob
      around me I made him wait till I had done and come again at the same time
      the next day, as I did not require any supper. The servant obeyed.
      Marazzini said rudely that I might at least have kept the bottle of wine;
      but I gave him no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o&rsquo;clock Manucci appeared, accompanied by a Spanish officer. After
      the usual compliments had passed between us I asked the officer if I might
      write to my friends, who would not allow me to stay much longer in prison
      if they were advised of my arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are no tyrants,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;you can write what letters you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;as this is a free country, is it allowable for a soldier
      who has received certain moneys to buy certain articles to pocket the
      money and appropriate it to his own use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guard had been relieved, and no one seemed to know who or where he
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you, sir,&rdquo; said the officer, &ldquo;that the soldier shall be
      punished and your money restored to you; and in the meanwhile you shall
      have pens, ink, paper, a table, and a candle, immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; added Manucci, &ldquo;promise you that one of the ambassador&rsquo;s servants
      shall wait on you at eight o&rsquo;clock to deliver any letters you may write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took three crowns from my pocket, and told my fellow-prisoners that the
      first to name the soldier who had deceived me should have the money;
      Marazzini was the first to do so. The officer made a note of the man&rsquo;s
      name with a smile; he was beginning to know me; I had spent three crowns
      to get back one, and could not be very avaricious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manucci whispered to me that the ambassador would do his best in a
      confidential way to get my release, and that he had no doubt of his
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      When my visitors were gone I sat down to write, but I had need of all my
      patience. The rascally prisoners crowded round me to read what I was
      writing, and when they could not understand it they were impudent enough
      to ask me to explain it to them. Under the pretext of snuffing the candle,
      they put it out. However, I bore with it all. One of the soldiers said he
      would keep them quiet for a crown, but I gave him no answer. In spite of
      the hell around me, I finished my letters and sealed them up. They were no
      studied or rhetorical epistles, but merely the expression of the fury with
      which I was consumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told Mocenigo that it was his duty to defend a subject of his prince,
      who had been arrested and imprisoned by a foreign power on an idle
      pretext. I shewed him that he must give me his protection unless I was
      guilty, and that I had committed no offence against the law of the land. I
      reminded him that I was a Venetian, in spite of my persecution at the
      hands of the State Inquisitors, and that being a Venetian I had a right to
      count on his protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Don Emmanuel de Roda, a learned scholar, and the minister of justice, I
      wrote that I did not ask any favour but only simple justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serve God and your master,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Let his Catholic majesty save me
      from the hands of the infamous alcalde who has arrested me, an honest and
      a law-abiding man, who came to Spain trusting in his own innocence and the
      protection of the laws. The person who writes to you, my lord, has a purse
      full of doubloons in his pocket; he has already been robbed, and fears
      assassination in the filthy den in which he has been imprisoned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wrote to the Duke of Lossada, requesting him to inform the king that his
      servants had subjected to vile treatment a man whose only fault was that
      he had a little money. I begged him to use his influence with his Catholic
      majesty to put a stop to these infamous proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the most vigorous letter of all was the one I addressed to the Count
      of Aranda. I told him plainly that if this infamous action went on I
      should be forced to believe that it was by his orders, since I had stated
      in vain that I came to Madrid with an introduction to him from a princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have committed no crime,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;what compensation am I to have when
      I am released from this filthy and abominable place? Set me at liberty at
      once, or tell your hangmen to finish their work, for I warn you that no
      one shall take me to the galleys alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      According to my custom I took copies of all the letters, and I sent them
      off by the servant whom the all-powerful Manucci despatched to the prison.
      I passed such a night as Dante might have imagined in his Vision of Hell.
      All the beds were full, and even if there had been a spare place I would
      not have occupied it. I asked in vain for a mattress, but even if they had
      brought me one, it would have been of no use, for the whole floor was
      inundated. There were only two or three chamber utensils for all the
      prisoners, and everyone discharged his occasions on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent the night on a narrow bench without a back, resting my head on my
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o&rsquo;clock the next morning Manucci came to see me; I looked upon
      him as my Providence. I begged him to take me down to the guard-room, and
      give me some refreshment, for I felt quite exhausted. My request was
      granted, and as I told my sufferings I had my hair done by a barber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manucci told me that my letters would be delivered in the course of the
      day, and observed, smilingly, that my epistle to the ambassador was rather
      severe. I shewed him copies of the three others I had written, and the
      inexperienced young man told me that gentleness was the best way to obtain
      favours. He did not know that there are circumstances in which a man&rsquo;s pen
      must be dipped in gall. He told me confidentially that the ambassador
      dined with Aranda that day, and would speak in my favour as a private
      individual, adding that he was afraid my letter would prejudice the proud
      Spaniard against me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I ask of you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is not to tell the ambassador that you have
      seen the letter I wrote to the Count of Aranda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He promised he would keep the secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour after his departure I saw Donna Ignazia and her father coming in,
      accompanied by the officer who had treated me with such consideration.
      Their visit cut me to the quick; nevertheless, I felt grateful, for it
      shewed me the goodness of Don Diego&rsquo;s heart and the love of the fair
      devotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave them to understand, in my bad Spanish, that I was grateful for the
      honour they had done me in visiting me in this dreadful situation. Donna
      Ignazia did not speak, she only wept in silence; but Don Diego gave me
      clearly to understand that he would never have come to see me unless he
      had felt certain that my accusation was a mistake or an infamous calumny.
      He told me he was sure I should be set free, and that proper satisfaction
      would be given me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;for I am perfectly innocent of any offence.&rdquo; I
      was greatly touched when the worthy man slipped into my hands a rouleau,
      telling me it contained twelve quadruples, which I could repay at my
      convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was more than a thousand francs, and my hair stood on end. I pressed
      his hand warmly, and whispered to him that I had fifty in my pocket, which
      I was afraid to shew him, for fear the rascals around might rob me. He put
      back his rouleau, and bade me farewell in tears, and I promised to come
      and see him as soon as I should be set at liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not sent in his name, and as he was very well dressed he was taken
      for a man of importance. Such characters are not altogether exceptional in
      heroic Spain; it is a land of extremes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon Mengs&rsquo;s servant came with a dinner that was choicer than before,
      but not so plentiful. This was just what I liked. He waited for me to
      finish, and went away with the plates, carrying my heartiest thanks to his
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one o&rsquo;clock an individual came up to me and bade me follow him. He took
      me to a small room, where I saw my carbine and pistols. In front of me was
      the Alcalde Messa, seated at a table covered with documents, and a
      policeman stood on each side of him. The alcalde told me to sit down, and
      to answer truly such questions as might be put to me, warning me that my
      replies would be taken down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand Spanish well, and I shall only give written answers
      to any questions that may be asked of me, in Italian, French, or Latin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This reply, which I uttered in a firm and determined voice, seemed to
      astonish him. He spoke to me for an hour, and I understood him very well,
      but he only got one reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you say. Get a judge who understands one of the
      languages I have named, and I will write down my answers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The alcalde was enraged, but I did not let his ill-humour or his threats
      disturb me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he gave me a pen, and told me to write my name, profession, and
      business in Spain in Italian. I could not refuse him this pleasure, so I
      wrote as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Jacques Casanova; I am a subject of the Republic of Venice, by
      profession a man of letters, and in rank a Knight of the Golden Spur. I
      have sufficient means, and I travel for my pleasure. I am known to the
      Venetian ambassador, the Count of Aranda, the Prince de la Catolica, the
      Marquis of Moras, and the Duke of Lossada. I have offended in no manner
      against the laws of his Catholic majesty, but in spite of my innocence I
      have been cast into a den of thieves and assassins by magistrates who
      deserve a ten times greater punishment. Since I have not infringed the
      laws, his Catholic majesty must know that he has only one right over me,
      and that is to order me to leave his realms, which order I am ready to
      obey. My arms, which I see before me, have travelled with me for the last
      eleven years; I carry them to defend myself against highwaymen. They were
      seen when my effects were examined at the Gate of Alcala, and were not
      confiscated; which makes it plain that they have served merely as a
      pretext for the infamous treatment to which I have been subjected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After I had written out this document I gave it to the alcalde, who called
      for an interpreter. When he had had it read to him he rose angrily and
      said to me,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Valga me Dios! You shall suffer for your insolence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this threat he went away, ordering that I should be taken back to
      prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o&rsquo;clock Manucci called and told me that the Count of Aranda had
      been making enquiries about me of the Venetian ambassador, who had spoken
      very highly in my favour, and expressed his regret that he could not take
      my part officially on account of my being in disgrace with the State
      Inquisitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has certainly been shamefully used,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;but an
      intelligent man should not lose his head. I should have known nothing
      about it, but for a furious letter he has written me; and Don Emmanuel de
      Roda and the Duke of Lossada have received epistles in the same style.
      Casanova is in the right, but that is not the way to address people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he really said I was in the right, that is sufficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said it, sure enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he must do me justice, and as to my style everyone has a style of
      their own. I am furious, and I wrote furiously. Look at this place; I have
      no bed, the floor is covered with filth, and I am obliged to sleep on a
      narrow bench. Don&rsquo;t you think it is natural that I should desire to eat
      the hearts of the scoundrels who have placed me here? If I do not leave
      this hell by tomorrow, I shall kill myself, or go mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manucci understood the horrors of my situation. He promised to come again
      early the next day, and advised me to see what money would do towards
      procuring a bed, but I would not listen to him, for I was suffering from
      injustice, and was therefore obstinate. Besides, the thought of the vermin
      frightened me, and I was afraid for my purse and the jewels I had about
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent a second night worse than the first, going to sleep from sheer
      exhaustion, only to awake and find myself slipping off the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manucci came before eight o&rsquo;clock, and my aspect shocked him. He had come
      in his carriage, bringing with him some excellent chocolate, which in some
      way restored my spirits. As I was finishing it, an officer of high rank,
      accompanied by two other officers, came in and called out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Casanova!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stepped forward and presented myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chevalier,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;the Count of Aranda is at the gate of the prison;
      he is much grieved at the treatment you have received. He only heard about
      it through the letter you wrote him yesterday, and if you had written
      sooner your pains would have been shorter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such was my intention, colonel, but a soldier . . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I proceeded to tell him the story of the swindling soldier, and on hearing
      his name the colonel called the captain of the guard, reprimanded him
      severely, and ordered him to give me back the crown himself. I took the
      money laughingly, and the colonel then ordered the captain to fetch the
      offending soldier, and to give him a flogging before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      This officer, the emissary of the all-powerful Aranda, was Count Royas,
      commanding the garrison of Buen Retiro. I told him all the circumstances
      of my arrest, and of my imprisonment in that filthy place. I told him that
      if I did not get back that day my arms, my liberty, and my honour, I
      should either go mad or kill myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I can neither rest nor sleep, and a man needs sleep every
      night. If you had come a little earlier you would have seen the disgusting
      filth with which the floor was covered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The worthy man was taken aback with the energy with which I spoke. I saw
      his feelings, and hastened to say,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must remember, colonel, that I am suffering from injustice, and am in
      a furious rage. I am a man of honour, like yourself, and you can imagine
      the effect of such treatment on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manucci told him, in Spanish, that in my normal state I was a good fellow
      enough. The colonel expressed his pity for me, and assured me that my arms
      should be restored to me, and my liberty too, in the course of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afterwards,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you must go and thank his excellency the Count of
      Aranda, who came here expressly for your sake. He bade me tell you that
      your release would be delayed till the afternoon, that you may have full
      satisfaction for the affront you have received, if it is an affront, for
      the penalties of the law only dishonour the guilty. In this instance the
      Alcalde Messa has been deceived by the rascal who was in your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Be good enough to have him removed, or else, in my
      indignation, I might kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall be taken away this moment,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel went out, and two minutes later two soldiers came in and took
      the rogue away between them. I never saw him again, and never troubled
      myself to enquire what had become of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel begged me to accompany him to the guard-room, to see the
      thieving soldier flogged. Manucci was at my side, and at some little
      distance stood the Count of Aranda, surrounded by officers, and
      accompanied by a royal guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business kept us there for a couple of hours. Before leaving me the
      colonel begged me to meet Mengs at dinner at his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I returned to my filthy prison I found a clean arm-chair, which I was
      informed had been brought in for me. I sat down in it immediately, and
      Manucci left me, after embracing me again and again. He was my sincere
      friend, and I can never forgive myself the stupidity which made me offend
      him grievously. He never forgave me, at which I am not surprised, but I
      believe my readers will agree with me in thinking that he carried his
      vengeance too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the scene which had taken place, the vile crowd of prisoners stood
      gazing at me in stupid silence, and Marazzini came up to me and begged me
      to use my offices for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was brought me as usual, and at three o&rsquo;clock the Alcalde Messa
      appeared and begged me to follow him, as he had received orders to take me
      back to my lodging, where he hoped I should find everything in perfect
      order. At the same time he shewed me my arms, which one of his men was
      going to bring to my house. The officer of the guard returned me my sword,
      the alcalde, who was in his black cloak, put himself on my left hand, and
      thus I was escorted home with a guard of thirty constables. The seals were
      removed from my apartment, and after a brief inspection I pronounced that
      everything was in perfect order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had not a rascal and a traitor (who shall end his days in the
      galleys) in your service, Senor Caballero, you would never have written
      down the servants of his Catholic majesty as scoundrels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Senor Alcalde, my indignation made me write the same sentence to four of
      his majesty&rsquo;s ministers. Then I believed what I wrote, but I do so no
      longer. Let us forget and forgive; but you must confess that if I had not
      known how to write a letter you would have sent me to the galleys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! it is very likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I need not say that I hastened to remove all traces of the vile prison
      where I had suffered so much. When I was ready to go out my first grateful
      visit was paid to the noble cobbler. The worthy man was proud of the
      fulfilment of his prophecy, and glad to see me again. Donna Ignazia was
      wild with delight&mdash;perhaps she had not been so sure of my release&mdash;and
      when Don Diego heard of the satisfaction that had been given me he said
      that a grandee of Spain could not have asked for more. I begged the worthy
      people to come and dine with me, telling them that I would name the day
      another time, and they accepted gladly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt that my love for Donna Ignazia had increased immensely since our
      last meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards I called on Mengs, who with his knowledge of Spanish law
      expected nothing less than to see me. When he heard of my triumphant
      release he overwhelmed me with congratulations. He was in his Court dress&mdash;an
      unusual thing with him, and on my asking him the reason he told me that he
      had been to Don Emmanuel de Roda&rsquo;s to speak on my behalf, but had not
      succeeded in obtaining an audience. He gave me a Venetian letter which had
      just arrived for me. I opened it, and found it was from M. Dandolo, and
      contained an enclosure for M. de Mocenigo. M. Dandolo said that on reading
      the enclosed letter the ambassador would have no more scruples about
      introducing me, as it contained a recommendation from one of the
      Inquisitors on behalf of the three.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I told Mengs of this he said it was now in my power to make my
      fortune in Spain, and that now was the time when all the ministers would
      be only too anxious to do something for me to make me forget the wrongs I
      had received.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I advise you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to take the letter to the ambassador
      immediately. Take my carriage; after what you have undergone for the last
      few days you cannot be in a walking humour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had need of rest, and told Mengs that I would not sup with him that
      night, but would dine with him the next day. The ambassador was out, so I
      left the letter with Manucci, and then drove home and slept profoundly for
      twelve hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manucci came to see me the next day in high spirits, and told me that M.
      Girolamo Zulian had written to the ambassador on behalf of M. du Mula,
      informing him that he need not hesitate to countenance me, as any articles
      the Tribunal might have against me were in no degree prejudicial to my
      honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ambassador,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;proposes to introduce you at Court next
      week, and he wants you to dine with him to-day; there will be a numerous
      company at dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am engaged to Mengs.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;No matter, he shall be asked as well; you must come. Consider the effect
      of your presence at the ambassador&rsquo;s the day after your triumph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. Go and ask Mengs, and tell the ambassador that I have much
      pleasure in accepting his invitation.&rdquo;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Campomanes&mdash;Olavides&mdash;Sierra Morena&mdash;Aranjuez&mdash;Mengs&mdash;The
     Marquis Grimaldi&mdash;Toledo&mdash;Madame Pelliccia&mdash;My Return to
     Madrid
</pre>
    <p>
      Different circumstances in my life seem to have combined to render me
      somewhat superstitious; it is a humiliating confession, and yet I make it.
      But who could help it? A man who abandons himself to his whims and fancies
      is like a child playing with a billiard cue. It may make a stroke that
      would be an honour to the most practised and scientific player; and such
      are the strange coincidences of life which, as I have said, have caused me
      to become superstitious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune, which under the humbler name of luck seems but a word, is a very
      divinity when it guides the most important actions of a man&rsquo;s life. Always
      it has seemed to me that this divinity is not blind, as the mythologists
      affirm; she had brought me low only to exalt me, and I found myself in
      high places, only, as it seems, to be cast into the depths. Fortune has
      done her best to make me regard her as a reasoning, almighty power; she
      has made me feel that the strength of my will is as nothing before this
      mysterious power, which takes my will and moulds it, and makes it a mere
      instrument for the accomplishment of its decrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not possibly have done anything in Spain without the help of the
      representative of my country, and he would not have dared to do anything
      for me without the letter I had just given him. This letter, in its turn,
      would probably have had but slight effect if it had not come to hand so
      soon after my imprisonment, which had become the talk of the town, through
      the handsome satisfaction the Count of Aranda had given me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter made the ambassador sorry that he had not interposed on my
      behalf, but he hoped people would believe that the count would not have
      acted as he did if it had not been for his interposition. His favourite,
      Count Manucci, had come to ask me to dinner; as it happened I was engaged
      to Mengs, which obtained an invitation for the painter, and flattered his
      vanity excessively. He fancied that the invitation proceeded from
      gratitude, and it certainly smoothed away the mortification he had felt at
      seeing me arrested in his house. He immediately wrote to the effect that
      he would call upon me with his carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I called on the Count of Aranda, who kept me waiting for a quarter of an
      hour, and then came in with some papers in his hand. He smiled when he saw
      me, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your business is done. Stay, here are four letters; take them and read
      them over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I read them again? This is the document I gave the alcalde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that. Read, and confess that you should not have written so
      violently, in spite of the wrongs that vexed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I crave your pardon, my lord, but a man who meditates suicide does not
      pick terms. I believed that your excellency was at the bottom of it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know me. Go and thank Don Emmanuel de Roda, who wants to
      know you, and I shall be glad if you will call once on the alcalde, not to
      make him an apology, for you owe him none, but as an act of politeness to
      salve over the hard things you said of him. If you write the history of
      Princess Lubomirska, I hope you will tell her that I did my best for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I then called on Colonel Royas, who told me that I had made a great
      mistake in saying that I was satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could I claim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything. Dismissal of the alcalde and compensation to the tune of
      fifty thousand duros. Spain is a country where a man may speak out save in
      the matters which the Holy Inquisition looks after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This colonel, now a general, is one of the pleasantest Spaniards I have
      ever met.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not long returned to my lodging when Mengs called for me in his
      carriage. The ambassador gave me a most gracious reception, and
      overwhelmed Mengs with compliments for having endeavoured to shelter me.
      At dinner I told the story of my sufferings at Buen Retiro, and the
      conversation I had just had with the Count of Aranda, who had returned me
      my letters. The company expressed a desire to see them, and everyone gave
      an opinion on the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests were Abbe Bigliardi, the French consul, Don Rodrigues de
      Campomanes, and the famous Don Pablo d&rsquo;Olavides. Everyone spoke his mind,
      and the ambassador condemned the letters as too ferocious. On the other
      hand, Campomanes approved them, saying that they were not abusive, and
      were wonderfully adapted to my purpose, namely, to force the reader to do
      me prompt justice, were the reader to be the king himself. Olavides and
      Bigliardi echoed this sentiment. Mengs sided with the ambassador, and
      begged me to come and live with him, so as not to be liable to any more
      inconveniences from spying servants. I did not accept this invitation till
      I had been pressed for some time, and I noted the remark of the
      ambassador, who said I owed Mengs this reparation for the indirect affront
      he had received.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was delighted to make the acquaintance of Campomanes and Olavides, men
      of intellect and of a stamp very rare in Spain. They were not exactly men
      of learning, but they were above religious prejudices, and were not only
      fearless in throwing public scorn upon them but even laboured openly for
      their destruction. It was Campomanes who had furnished Aranda with all the
      damaging matter against the Jesuits. By a curious coincidence, Campomanes,
      the Count of Aranda, and the General of the Jesuits, were all squint-eyed.
      I asked Campomanes why he hated the Jesuits so bitterly, and he replied
      that he looked upon them in the same light as the other religious orders,
      whom he considered a parasitical and noxious race, and would gladly banish
      them all, not only from the peninsula but from the face of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the author of all the pamphlets that had been written on the
      subject of mortmain; and as he was an intimate friend of the ambassador&rsquo;s,
      M. Mocenigo had furnished him with an account of the proceedings of the
      Venetian Republic against the monks. He might have dispensed with this
      source of information if he had read the writings of Father Paul Sarpi on
      the same subject. Quick-sighted, firm, with the courage of his opinions,
      Campomanes was the fiscal of the Supreme Council of Castille, of which
      Aranda was president. Everyone knew him to be a thoroughly honest man, who
      acted solely for the good of the State. Thus statesmen and officials had
      warm feelings of respect for him, while the monks and bigots hated the
      sound of his name, and the Inquisition had sworn to be his ruin. It was
      said openly that he would either become a bishop or perish in the cells of
      the holy brotherhood. The prophecy was only partly fulfilled. Four years
      after my visit to Spain he was incarcerated in the dungeons of the
      Inquisition, but he obtained his release after three years&rsquo; confinement by
      doing public penance. The leprosy which eats out the heart of Spain is not
      yet cured. Olavides was still more harshly treated, and even Aranda would
      have fallen a victim if he had not had the good sense to ask the king to
      send him to France as his ambassador. The king was very glad to do so, as
      otherwise he would have been forced to deliver him up to the infuriated
      monks. Charles III. (who died a madman) was a remarkable character. He was
      as obstinate as a mule, as weak as a woman, as gross as a Dutchman, and a
      thorough-paced bigot. It was no wonder that he became the tool of his
      confessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of which I am speaking the cabinet of Madrid was occupied in a
      curious scheme. A thousand Catholic families had been enticed from
      Switzerland to form a colony in the beautiful but deserted region called
      the Sierra Morena, well known all over Europe by its mention in Don
      Quixote. Nature seemed there to have lavished all her gifts; the climate
      was perfect, the soil fertile, and streams of all kinds watered the land,
      but in spite of all it was almost depopulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Desiring to change this state of things, his Catholic majesty had decided
      to make a present of all the agricultural products for a certain number of
      years to industrious colonists. He had consequently invited the Swiss
      Catholics, and had paid their expenses for the journey. The Swiss arrived,
      and the Spanish government did its best to provide them with lodging and
      spiritual and temporal superintendence. Olavides was the soul of this
      scheme. He conferred with the ministers to provide the new population with
      magistrates, priests, a governor, craftsmen of all kinds to build churches
      and houses, and especially a bull-ring, a necessity for the Spaniards, but
      a perfectly useless provision as far as the simple Swiss were concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the documents which Don Pablo Olavides had composed on the subject he
      demonstrated the inexpediency of establishing any religious orders in the
      new colony, but if he could have proved his opinion to be correct with
      foot and rule he would none the less have drawn on his head the implacable
      hatred of the monks, and of the bishop in whose diocese the new colony was
      situated. The secular clergy supported Olavides, but the monks cried out
      against his impiety, and as the Inquisition was eminently monkish in its
      sympathies persecution had already begun, and this was one of the subjects
      of conversation at the dinner at which I was present.
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened to the arguments, sensible and otherwise, which were advanced,
      and I finally gave my opinion, as modestly as I could, that in a few years
      the colony would banish like smoke; and this for several reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Swiss,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;are a very peculiar people; if you transplant them
      to a foreign shore, they languish and die; they become a prey to
      home-sickness. When this once begins in a Switzer, the only thing is to
      take him home to the mountain, the lake, or the valley, where he was born,
      or else he will infallibly die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be wise, I think,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;to endeavour to combine a
      Spanish colony with the Swiss colony, so as to effect a mingling of races.
      At first, at all events, their rules, both spiritual and temporal, should
      be Swiss, and, above all, you would have to insure them complete immunity
      from the Inquisition. The Swiss who has been bred in the country has
      peculiar customs and manners of love-making, of which the Spanish Church
      might not exactly approve; but the least attempt to restrain their liberty
      in this respect would immediately bring about a general home-sickness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At first Olavides thought I was joking, but he soon found out that my
      remarks had some sense in them. He begged me to write out my opinions on
      the subject, and to give him the benefit of my knowledge. I promised to do
      so, and Mengs fixed a day for him to come and dine with me at his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I moved my household goods to Mengs&rsquo;s house, and began my
      philosophical and physiological treatise on the colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      I called on Don Emmanuel de Roda, who was a man of letters, a &lsquo;rara avis&rsquo;
      in Spain. He liked Latin poetry, had read some Italian, but very naturally
      gave the palm to the Spanish poets. He welcomed me warmly, begged me to
      come and see him again, and told me how sorry he had been at my unjust
      imprisonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Lossada congratulated me on the way in which the Venetian
      ambassador spoke of me everywhere, and encouraged me in my idea of getting
      some place under Government, promising to give me his support in the
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince della Catolica, invited me to dinner with the Venetian
      ambassador; and in the course of three weeks I had made a great number of
      valuable acquaintances. I thought seriously of seeking employment in
      Spain, as not having heard from Lisbon I dared not go there on the chance
      of finding something to do. I had not received any letters from Pauline of
      late, and had no idea as to what had become of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I passed a good many of my evenings with a Spanish lady, named Sabatini,
      who gave &lsquo;tertullas&rsquo; or assemblies, frequented chiefly by fifth-rate
      literary men. I also visited the Duke of Medina-Sidonia, a well-read and
      intelligent man, to whom I had been presented by Don Domingo Varnier, one
      of the gentlemen of the king&rsquo;s chamber, whom I had met at Mengs&rsquo;s house. I
      paid a good many visits to Donna Ignazia, but as I was never left alone
      with her these visits became tiresome. When I suggested a party of
      pleasure with her and her cousins, she replied that she would like it as
      much as I, but as it was Lent and near Holy Week, in which God died for
      our salvation, it was more fit to think of penance than pleasure. After
      Easter, she said, we might consider the matter. Ignazia was a perfect
      example of the young Spanish devotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fortnight after, the King and Court left Madrid for Aranjuez. M. de
      Mocenigo asked me to come and stay with him, as he would be able to
      present me at Court. As may be imagined, I should have been only too glad
      to accept, but on the eve of my departure, as I was driving with Mengs, I
      was suddenly seized with a fever, and was convulsed so violently that my
      head was dashed against the carriage window, which it shivered to
      fragments. Mengs ordered the coachman to drive home, and I was put to bed.
      In four hours I was seized with a sweating fit, which lasted for ten or
      twelve hours. The bed and two mattresses were soaked through with my
      perspiration, which dripped on to the floor beneath. The fever abated in
      forty-eight hours, but left me in such a state of weakness that I was kept
      to my bed for a whole week, and could not go to Aranjuez till Holy
      Saturday. The ambassador welcomed me warmly, but on the night I arrived a
      small lump which I had felt in the course of the day grew as large as an
      egg, and I was unable to go to mass on Easter Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In five days the excrescence became as large as an average melon, much to
      the amazement of Manucci and the ambassador, and even of the king&rsquo;s
      surgeon, a Frenchman who declared he had never seen the like before. I was
      not alarmed personally, for, as I suffered no pain and the lump was quite
      soft, I guessed it was only a collection of lymph, the remainder of the
      evil humours which I had sweated away in the fever. I told the surgeon the
      history of the fever and begged him to lance the abscess, which he did,
      and for four days the opening discharged an almost incredible amount of
      matter. On the fifth day the wound was almost healed, but the exhaustion
      had left me so weak that I could not leave my bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was my situation when I received a letter from Mengs. It is before me
      at the present moment, and I give below a true copy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday the rector of the parish in which I reside affixed to the
      church-door a list of those of his parishioners who are Atheists and have
      neglected their Easter duties. Amongst them your name figures in full, and
      the aforesaid rector has reproached me bitterly for harbouring a heretic.
      I did not know what answer to make, for I feel sure that you could have
      stopped in Madrid a day longer to discharge the duties of a Christian,
      even if it were only out of regard for me. The duty I owe to the king, my
      master, the care I am bound to take of my reputation, and my fears of
      being molested, all make me request you to look upon my house as yours no
      longer. When you return to Madrid you may go where you will, and my
      servants shall transport your effects to your new abode.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, etc., &ldquo;ANTONIO RAPHAEL MENGS.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was so annoyed by this rude, brutal, and ungrateful letter, that if I
      had not been seven leagues from Madrid, and in a state of the utmost
      weakness, Mengs should have suffered for his insolence. I told the
      messenger who had brought it to begone, but he replied that he had orders
      to await my reply. I crushed the letter in my hand and flung it at his
      face, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and tell your unworthy master what I did with his letter, and tell him
      that is the only answer that such a letter deserves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The innocent messenger went his way in great amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      My anger gave me strength, and having dressed myself and summoned a
      sedan-chair I went to church, and was confessed by a Grey Friar, and at
      six o&rsquo;clock the next morning I received the Sacrament.
    </p>
    <p>
      My confessor was kind enough to give me a certificate to the effect that I
      had been obliged to keep my bed since my arrival &lsquo;al sitio&rsquo;, and that in
      spite of my extreme weakness I had gone to church, and had confessed and
      communicated like a good Christian. He also told me the name of the priest
      who had affixed the paper containing my name to the door of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I returned to the ambassador&rsquo;s house I wrote to this priest, telling
      him that the certificate enclosed would inform him as to my reasons for
      not communicating. I expressed a hope that, being satisfied of my
      orthodoxy, he would not delay in removing my name from his church-doors,
      and I concluded by begging him to hand the enclosed letter to the
      Chevalier Mengs.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the painter I wrote that I felt that I had deserved the shameful insult
      he had given me by my great mistake in acceding to his request to honour
      him by staying in his house. However, as a good Christian who had just
      received the Holy Communion, I told him that his brutal behaviour was
      forgiven; but I bade him to take to heart the line, well known to all
      honest people, and doubtless unknown to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Turpius ejicitur quam non admittitur hospes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After sending the letter I told the ambassador what had happened, to which
      he replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at all surprised at what you tell me. Mengs is only liked for
      his talents in painting; in everything else he is well known to be little
      better than a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact he had only asked me to stay with him to gratify his
      own vanity. He knew that all the town was talking of my imprisonment and
      of the satisfaction the Count of Aranda had accorded me, and he wanted
      people to think that his influence had obtained the favour that had been
      shewn me. Indeed, he had said in a moment of exaltation that I should have
      compelled the Alcade Messa to escort me not to my own house but to his, as
      it was in his house that I had been arrested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mengs was an exceedingly ambitious and a very jealous man; he hated all
      his brother painters. His colour and design were excellent, but his
      invention was very weak, and invention is as necessary to a great painter
      as a great poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      I happened to say to him one day, &ldquo;Just as every poet should be a painter,
      so every painter should be a poet;&rdquo; and he got quite angry, thinking that
      I was alluding to his weakness of imagination, which he felt but would not
      acknowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an ignorant man, and liked to pass for a scholar; he sacrificed to
      Bacchus and Comus, and would fain be thought sober; he was lustful,
      bad-tempered, envious, and miserly, but yet would be considered a virtuous
      man. He loved hard work, and this forced him to abstain, as a rule, from
      dinner, as he drank so inordinately at that meal that he could do nothing
      after it. When he dined out he had to drink nothing but water, so as not
      to compromise his reputation for temperance. He spoke four languages, and
      all badly, and could not even write his native tongue with correctness;
      and yet he claimed perfection for his grammar and orthography, as for all
      his other qualities. While I was staying with him I became acquainted with
      some of his weak points, and endeavoured to correct them, at which he took
      great offence. The fellow writhed under a sense of obligation to me. Once
      I prevented his sending a petition to the Court, which the king would have
      seen, and which would have made Mengs ridiculous. In signing his name he
      had written &lsquo;el mas inclito&rsquo;, wishing to say your most humble. I pointed
      out to him that &lsquo;el mas inclito&rsquo; meant the most illustrious, and that the
      Spanish for the expression he wanted was &lsquo;el mas humilde&rsquo;. The proud fool
      was quite enraged, telling me that he knew Spanish better than I, but when
      the dictionary was searched he had to swallow the bitter pill of
      confessing himself in the wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another time I suppressed a heavy and stupid criticism of his on someone
      who had maintained that there were no monuments still existing of the
      antediluvian period. Mengs thought he would confound the author by citing
      the remains of the Tower of Babel&mdash;a double piece of folly, for in
      the first place there are no such remains, and in the second, the Tower of
      Babel was a post-diluvian building.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was also largely given to the discussion of metaphysical questions, on
      which his knowledge was simply nil, and a favourite pursuit of his was
      defining beauty in the abstract, and when he was on this topic the
      nonsense he talked was something dreadful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mengs was a very passionate man, and would sometimes beat his children
      most cruelly. More than once I have rescued his poor sons from his furious
      hands. He boasted that his father, a bad Bohemian artist, had brought him
      up with the stick. Thus, he said, he had become a great painter, and he
      wished his own children to enjoy the same advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was deeply offended when he received a letter, of which the address
      omitted his title of chevalier, and his name, Rafael. One day I ventured
      to say that these things were but trifles after all, and that I had taken
      no offence at his omitting the chevalier on the letters he had written to
      me, though I was a knight of the same order as himself. He very wisely
      made no answer; but his objection to the omission of his baptismal name
      was a very ridiculous one. He said he was called Antonio after Antonio
      Correggio, and Rafael after Rafael da Urbino, and that those who omitted
      these names, or either of them, implicitly denied his possession of the
      qualities of both these great painters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once I dared to tell him that he had made a mistake in the hand of one of
      his figures, as the ring finger was shorter than the index. He replied
      sharply that it was quite right, and shewed me his hand by way of proof. I
      laughed, and shewed him my hand in return, saying that I was certain that
      my hand was made like that of all the descendants of Adam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then whom do you think that I am descended from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but you are certainly not of the same species as myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you are not of my species; all well-made hands of men, and women
      too, are like mine and not like yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager a hundred doubloons that you are in the wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up, threw down brushes and palette, and rang up his servants,
      saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see which is right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servants came, and on examination he found that I was right. For once
      in his life, he laughed and passed it off as a joke, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted that I can boast of being unique in one particular, at all
      events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here I must note another very sensible remark of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had painted a Magdalen, which was really wonderfully beautiful. For ten
      days he had said every morning, &ldquo;The picture will be finished to-night.&rdquo;
       At last I told him that he had made a mistake in saying it would be
      finished, as he was still working on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have not,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;ninety-nine connoisseurs out of a hundred
      would have pronounced it finished long ago, but I want the praise of the
      hundredth man. There&rsquo;s not a picture in the world that can be called
      finished save in a relative sense; this Magdalen will not be finished till
      I stop working at it, and then it will be only finished relatively, for if
      I were to give another day&rsquo;s work to it it would be more finished still.
      Not one of Petrarch&rsquo;s sonnets is a really finished production; no, nor any
      other man&rsquo;s sonnets. Nothing that the mind of man can conceive is perfect,
      save it be a mathematical theorem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I expressed my warm approval of the excellent way in which he had spoken.
      He was not so sensible another time when he expressed a wish to have been
      Raphael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was such a great painter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but what can you mean by wishing you had been
      Raphael? This is not sense; if you had been Raphael, you would no longer
      be existing. But perhaps you only meant to express a wish that you were
      tasting the joys of Paradise; in that case I will say no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; I mean I would have liked to have been Raphael without troubling
      myself about existing now, either in soul or body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really such a desire is an absurdity; think it over, and you will see it
      for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flew into a rage, and abused me so heartily that I could not help
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another time he made a comparison between a tragic author and a painter,
      of course to the advantage of the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I analysed the matter calmly, shewing him that the painter&rsquo;s labour is to
      a great extent purely mechanical, and can be done whilst engaged in casual
      talk; whilst a well-written tragedy is the work of genius pure and simple.
      Therefore, the poet must be immeasurably superior to the painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find me if you can,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;a poet who can order his supper between the
      lines of his tragedy, or discuss the weather whilst he is composing epic
      verses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Mengs was beaten in an argument, instead of acknowledging his defeat,
      he invariably became brutal and insulting. He died at the age of fifty,
      and is regarded by posterity as a Stoic philosopher, a scholar, and a
      compendium of all the virtues; and this opinion must be ascribed to a fine
      biography of him in royal quarto, choicely printed, and dedicated to the
      King of Spain. This panegyric is a mere tissue of lies. Mengs was a great
      painter, and nothing else; and if he had only produced the splendid
      picture which hangs over the high altar of the chapel royal at Dresden, he
      would deserve eternal fame, though indeed he is indebted to the great
      Raphael for the idea of the painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall hear more of Mengs when I describe my meeting with him at Rome,
      two or three years later.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was still weak and confined to my room when Manucci came to me, and
      proposed that I should go with him to Toledo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ambassador,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is going to give a grand official dinner to
      the ambassadors of the other powers, and as I have not been presented at
      Court I am excluded from being present. However, if I travel, my absence
      will not give rise to any remarks. We shall be back in five or six days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was delighted to have the chance of seeing Toledo, and of making the
      journey in a comfortable carriage, so I accepted. We started the next
      morning, and reached Toledo in the evening of the same day. For Spain we
      were lodged comfortably enough, and the next day we went out under the
      charge of a cicerone, who took us to the Alcazar, the Louvre of Toledo,
      formerly the palace of the Moorish kings. Afterwards we inspected the
      cathedral, which is well worthy of a visit, on account of the riches it
      contains. I saw the great tabernacle used on Corpus Christi. It is made of
      silver, and is so heavy that it requires thirty strong men to lift it. The
      Archbishop of Toledo has three hundred thousand duros a year, and his
      clergy have four hundred thousand, amounting to two million francs in
      French money. One of the canons, as he was shewing me the urns containing
      the relics, told me that one of them contained the thirty pieces of silver
      for which Judas betrayed our Lord. I begged him to let me see them, to
      which he replied severely that the king himself would not have dared to
      express such indecent curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hastened to apologise, begging him not to take offence at a stranger&rsquo;s
      heedless questions; and this seemed to calm his anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spanish priests are a band of knaves, but one has to treat them with
      more respect than one would pay to honest men elsewhere. The following day
      we were shewn the museum of natural history. It was rather a dull
      exhibition; but, at all events, one could laugh at it without exciting the
      wrath of the monks and the terrors of the Inquisition. We were shewn,
      amongst other wonders, a stuffed dragon, and the man who exhibited it
      said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This proves, gentlemen, that the dragon is not a fabulous animal;&rdquo; but I
      thought there was more of art than nature about the beast. He then shewed
      us a basilisk, but instead of slaying us with a glance it only made us
      laugh. The greatest wonder of all, however, was nothing else than a
      Freemason&rsquo;s apron, which, as the curator very sagely declared, proved the
      existence of such an order, whatever some might say.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey restored me to health, and when I returned to Aranjuez, I
      proceeded to pay my court to all the ministers. The ambassador presented
      me to Marquis Grimaldi, with whom I had some conversations on the subject
      of the Swiss colony, which was going on badly. I reiterated my opinion
      that the colony should be composed of Spaniards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but Spain is thinly peopled everywhere, and your plan
      would amount to impoverishing one district to make another rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, for if you took ten persons who are dying of poverty in the
      Asturias, and placed them in the Sierra Morena, they would not die till
      they had begotten fifty children. This fifty would beget two hundred and
      so on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My scheme was laid before a commission, and the marquis promised that I
      should be made governor of the colony if the plan was accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Italian Opera Comique was then amusing the Court, with the exception of
      the king, who had no taste for music. His majesty bore a considerable
      resemblance to a sheep in the face, and it seemed as if the likeness went
      deeper, for sheep have not the slightest idea of sound. His favourite
      pursuit was sport, and the reason will be given later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Italian musician at the Court desired to compose some music for a new
      opera, and as there was no time to send to Italy I offered to compose the
      libretto. My offer was accepted, and by the next day the first act was
      ready. The music was composed in four days, and the Venetian ambassador
      invited all the ministers to the rehearsal in the grand hall of his
      palace. The music was pronounced exquisite; the two other acts were
      written, and in a fortnight the opera was put upon the stage. The musician
      was rewarded handsomely, but I was considered too grand to work for money
      and my reward was paid me in the Court money of compliments. However, I
      was glad to see that the ambassador was proud of me and that the
      minister&rsquo;s esteem for me seemed increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      In writing the libretto I had become acquainted with the actresses. The
      chief of them was a Roman named Pelliccia, neither pretty nor ugly, with a
      slight squint, and but moderate talents. Her younger sister was pretty if
      not handsome; but no one cared for the younger, while the elder was a
      universal favourite. Her expression was pleasant, her smile delightful,
      and her manners most captivating. Her husband was an indifferent painter,
      plain-looking, and more like her servant than her husband. He was indeed
      her very humble servant, and she treated him with great kindness. The
      feelings she inspired me with were not love, but a sincere respect and
      friendship. I used to visit her every day, and wrote verses for her to
      sing to the Roman airs she delivered so gracefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one of the days of rehearsals I was pointing out to her the various
      great personages who were present. The manager of the company, Marescalchi
      by name, had entered into an arrangement with the Governor of Valentia to
      bring the company there in September to play comic opera in a small
      theatre which had been built on purpose. Italian opera had hitherto never
      been presented at Valentia, and Marecalchi hoped to make a good deal of
      money there. Madame Pelliccia knew nobody in Valentia, and wanted a letter
      of introduction to someone there. She asked me if I thought she could
      venture to ask the Venetian ambassador to do her the favour, but I advised
      her to try the Duke of Arcos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That gentleman who is looking in your direction now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I dare to ask him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a true nobleman, and I am sure he will be only too happy to oblige
      you. Go and ask him now; you will not be denied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the courage to do so. Come with me and introduce me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would spoil everything; he must not even think that I am your
      adviser in the matter. I am just going to leave you; you must make your
      request directly afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I walked towards the orchestra, and looking round I saw that the duke was
      approaching the actress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing&rsquo;s as good as done,&rdquo; I said to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the rehearsal was over Madame Pelliccia came and told me that the
      Duke would give her the letter on the day on which the opera was produced.
      He kept his word, and she received a sealed letter for a merchant and
      banker, Don Diego Valencia.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then May, and she was not to go to Valentia till September, so we
      shall hear what the letter contained later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I often saw the king&rsquo;s gentleman of the chamber, Don Domingo Varnier,
      another gentleman in the service of the Princess of the Asturias, and one
      of the princess&rsquo;s bed-chamber women. This most popular princess succeeded
      in suppressing a good deal of the old etiquette, and the tone of her Court
      had lost the air of solemnity common in Spanish society. It was a strange
      thing to see the King of Spain always dining at eleven o&rsquo;clock, like the
      Parisian cordwainers in the seventeenth century. His meal always consisted
      of the same dishes, he always went out hunting at the same hour, coming
      back in the evening thoroughly fatigued.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was ugly, but everything is relative, he was handsome compared
      with his brother, who was terrifically ugly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brother never went anywhere without a picture of the Virgin, which
      Mengs had painted for him. It was two feet high by three and a half broad.
      The figure was depicted as seated on the grass with legs crossed after the
      Eastern fashion, and uncovered up to the knees. It was, in reality, a
      voluptuous painting; and the prince mistook for devotion that which was
      really a sinful passion, for it was impossible to look upon the figure
      without desiring to have the original within one&rsquo;s arms. However, the
      prince did not see this, and was delighted to find himself in love with
      the mother of the Saviour. In this he was a true Spaniard; they only love
      pictures of this kind, and interpret the passions they excite in the most
      favourable sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Madrid I had seen a picture of the Madonna with the child at her
      breast. It was the altarpiece of a chapel in the Calle St. Jeronimo. The
      place was filled all day by the devout, who came to adore the Mother of
      God, whose figure was only interesting by reason of her magnificent
      breast. The alms given at this chapel were so numerous, that in the
      hundred and fifty years, since the picture had been placed there, the
      clergy had been able to purchase numerous lamps and candlesticks of
      silver, and vessels of silver gilt, and even of gold. The doorway was
      always blocked by carriages, and a sentinel was placed there to keep order
      amongst the coachmen; no nobleman would pass by without going in to pray
      to the Virgin, and to contemplate those &lsquo;beata ubera, quae lactaverunt
      aeterni patris filium&rsquo;. But there came a change.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I returned to Madrid I wanted to pay a visit to the Abbe Pico, and
      told my coachman to take another way so as to avoid the crush in front of
      the chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not so frequented now, senor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I can easily get by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on his way, and I found the entrance to the chapel deserted. As I
      was getting out of the carriage I asked my coachman what was the reason of
      the change, and he replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, senor! men are getting more wicked every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This reason did not satisfy me, and when I had taken my chocolate with the
      abbe, an intelligent and venerable old man, I asked him why the chapel in
      question had lost its reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He burst out laughing, and replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, I really cannot tell you. Go and see for yourself; your
      curiosity will soon be satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I left him I went to the chapel, and the state of the picture
      told me all. The breast of the Virgin had disappeared under a kerchief
      which some profane brush had dared to paint over it. The beautiful picture
      was spoilt; the magic and fascination had disappeared. Even the teat had
      been painted out; the Child held on to nothing, and the head of the Virgin
      no longer appeared natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      This disaster had taken place at the end of the Carnival of 1768. The old
      chaplain died, and the Vandal who succeeded him pronounced the painting to
      be a scandalous one, and robbed it of all its charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He may have been in the right as a fool, but as a Christian and a Spaniard
      he was certainly in the wrong, and he was probably soon convinced of the
      mistake he had made by the diminution in the offerings of the faithful.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interest in the study of human nature made me call on this priest, whom
      I expected to find a stupid old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went one morning, but instead of being old, the priest was an active,
      clever-looking man of thirty, who immediately offered me chocolate with
      the best grace imaginable. I refused, as was my duty as a stranger, and
      indeed the Spaniards offer visitors chocolate so frequently at all hours,
      that if one accepted it all one would be choked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lost no time in exordiums, but came to the point at once, by saying that
      as a lover of paintings I had been grieved at finding the magnificent
      Madonna spoilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but it was exactly the physical beauty of the
      picture that rendered it in my eyes unfit to represent one whose aspect
      should purify and purge the senses, instead of exciting them. Let all the
      pictures in the world be destroyed, if they be found to have caused the
      commission of one mortal sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who allowed you to commit this mutilation? The Venetian State
      Inquisitors, even M. Barberigo, though he is a devout man, would have put
      you under the Leads for such a deed. The love of Paradise should not be
      allowed to interfere with the fine arts, and I am sure that St. Luke
      himself (who was a painter, as you know) would condemn you if he could
      come to life again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I needed no one&rsquo;s leave or license. I have to say mass at that altar
      every day, and I am not ashamed to tell you that I was unable to
      consecrate. You are a man and a Christian, you can excuse my weakness.
      That voluptuous picture drew away my thoughts from holy things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who obliged you to look at it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not look at it; the devil, the enemy of God, made me see it in
      spite of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you should have mutilated yourself like Origen. Your generative
      organs, believe me, are not so valuable as the picture you have ruined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you insult me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, I have no intention of doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That young priest shewed me the door with such brusqueness that I felt
      sure he would inform against me to the Inquisition. I knew he would have
      no difficulty in finding out my name, so I resolved to be beforehand with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both my fear and my resolve were inspired by an incident which I shall
      mention as an episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days before, I had met a Frenchman named Segur, who had just come
      out of the prisons of the Inquisition. He had been shut up for three years
      for committing the following crime:
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall of his house there was a fountain, composed of a marble basin
      and the statue of a naked child, who discharged the water in the same way
      as the well-known statue of Brussels, that is to say, by his virile
      member. The child might be a Cupid or an Infant Jesus, as you pleased, but
      the sculptor had adorned the head with a kind of aureole; and so the
      fanatics declared that it was a mocking of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Segur was accused of impiety, and the Inquisition dealt with him
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt that my fault might be adjudged as great as Segur&rsquo;s, and not caring
      to run the risk of a like punishment I called on the bishop, who held the
      office of Grand Inquisitor, and told him word for word the conversation I
      had had with the iconoclast chaplain. I ended by craving pardon, if I had
      offended the chaplain, as I was a good Christian, and orthodox on all
      points.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had never expected to find the Grand Inquisitor of Madrid a kindly and
      intelligent, though ill-favoured, prelate; but so it was, and he did
      nothing but laugh from the beginning to the end of my story, for he would
      not let me call it a confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chaplain,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is himself blameworthy and unfit for his
      position, in that he has adjudged others to be as weak as himself; in
      fact, he has committed a wrong against religion. Nevertheless, my dear
      son, it was not wise of you to go and irritate him.&rdquo; As I had told him my
      name he shewed me, smilingly, an accusation against me, drawn up by
      someone who had witnessed the fact. The good bishop gently chid me for
      having called the friar-confessor of the Duke of Medina an ignoramus. He
      had refused to admit that a priest might say mass a second time on a high
      festival, after breaking his fast, on the command of his sovereign prince,
      who, by the hypothesis, had not heard mass before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were quite right in your contention,&rdquo; said the Inquisitor, &ldquo;but yet
      every truth is not good to utter, and it was wrong to call the man an
      ignoramus in his presence. For the future you would do well to avoid all
      idle discussion on religious matters, both on dogma and discipline. And I
      must also tell you, in order that you may not leave Spain with any harsh
      ideas on the Inquisition, that the priest who affixed your name to the
      church-door amongst the excommunicated has been severely reprimanded. He
      ought to have given you a fatherly admonition, and, above all, enquired as
      to your health, as we know that you were seriously ill at the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon I knelt down and kissed his hand, and went my way, well pleased
      with my call.
    </p>
    <p>
      To go back to Aranjuez. As soon as I heard that the ambassador could not
      put me up at Madrid, I wrote to the worthy cobbler, Don Diego, that I
      wanted a well-furnished room, a closet, a good bed, and an honest servant.
      I informed him how much I was willing to spend a month, and said I would
      leave Aranjuez as soon as I heard that everything was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was a good deal occupied with the question of colonising the Sierra
      Morena; I wrote principally on the subject of the civil government, a most
      important item in a scheme for a new colony. My articles pleased the
      Marquis Grimaldi and flattered Mocenigo; for the latter hoped that I
      should become governor of the colony, and that his embassy would thereby
      shine with a borrowed light.
    </p>
    <p>
      My labours did not prevent my amusing myself, and I frequented the society
      of those about the Court who could tell me most of the king and royal
      family. Don Varnier, a man of much frankness and intelligence, was my
      principal source of information.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him one day whether the king was fond of Gregorio Squillace only
      because he had been once his wife&rsquo;s lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an idle calumny,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;If the epithet of &lsquo;chaste&rsquo; can be
      applied to any monarch, Charles III. certainly deserves it better than any
      other. He has never touched any woman in his life except his wife, not
      only out of respect or the sanctity of marriage, but also as a good
      Christian. He has avoided this sin that his soul may remain pure, and so
      as not to have the shame of confessing it to his chaplain. He enjoys an
      iron constitution, sickness is unknown to him, and he is a thorough
      Spaniard in temperament. Ever since his marriage he has paid his duty to
      his wife every day, except when the state of her health compelled her to
      call for a truce. In such seasons this chaste husband brought down his
      fleshly desires by the fatigue of hunting and by abstinence. You can
      imagine his distress at being left a widower, for he would rather die than
      take a mistress. His only resource was in hunting, and in so planning out
      his day that he should have no time left wherein to think of women. It was
      a difficult matter, for he cares neither for reading nor writing, music
      wearies him, and conversation of a lively turn inspires him with disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has adopted the following plan, in which he will preserve till his
      dying day: He dresses at seven, then goes into his closet and has his hair
      dressed. At eight o&rsquo;clock he says his prayers, then hears mass, and when
      this is over he takes chocolate and an enormous pinch of snuff, over which
      his big nose ruminates for some minutes; this is his only pinch in the
      whole day. At nine o&rsquo;clock he sees his ministers, and works with them till
      eleven. Then comes dinner, which he always takes alone, then a short visit
      to the Princess of the Austurias, and at twelve sharp he gets into his
      carriage and drives to the hunting-grounds. At seven o&rsquo;clock he takes a
      morsel wherever he happens to be, and at eight o&rsquo;clock he comes home, so
      tired that he often goes to sleep before he can get his clothes off. Thus
      he keeps down the desires of the flesh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor voluntary martyr!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thought of marrying a second time, but when Adelaide of France saw his
      portrait she was quite frightened and refused him. He was very mortified,
      and renounced all thoughts of marriage; and woe to the courtier who should
      advise him to get a mistress!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In further speaking of his character Don Domingo told me that the
      ministers had good cause for making him inaccessible, as whenever anyone
      did succeed in getting at him and asked a favour, he made a point of
      granting it, as it was at such times that he felt himself really a king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he is not a hard man, as some say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. Kings seldom have the reputation they deserve. The most
      accessible monarchs are the least generous; they are overwhelmed with
      importunate requests, and their first instinct is always to refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as Charles III. is so inaccessible he can have no opportunity of
      either granting or refusing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People catch him when he is hunting; he is usually in a good humour then.
      His chief defect is his obstinacy; when he has once made up his mind there
      is no changing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has the greatest liking for his brother, and can scarce refuse him
      anything, though he must be master in all things. It is thought he will
      give him leave to marry for the sake of his salvation; the king has the
      greatest horror of illegitimate children, and his brother has three
      already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were an immense number of persons at Aranjuez, who persecuted the
      ministers in the hope of getting employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will go back as they come,&rdquo; said Don Domingo, &ldquo;and that is
      empty-handed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they ask impossibilities?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t ask anything. &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; says a minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What your excellency will let me have.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What can you do?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am ready to do whatever your excellency pleases to think best for me&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Please leave me. I have no time to waste.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That is always the way. Charles III. died a madman; the Queen of Portugal
      is mad; the King of England has been mad, and, as some say, is not really
      cured. There is nothing astonishing in it; a king who tries to do his duty
      is almost forced into madness by his enormous task.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took leave of M. Mocenigo three days before he left Aranjuez, and I
      embraced Manucci affectionately. He had been most kind to me throughout my
      stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      My cobbler had written to tell me that for the sum I had mentioned he
      could provide me with a Biscayan maid who could cook. He sent me the
      address of my new lodging in the Calle Alcala. I arrived there in the
      afternoon, having started from Aranjuez in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found that the Biscayan maid could speak French; my room was a very
      pleasant one, with another chamber annexed where I could lodge a friend.
      After I had had my effects carried up I saw my man, whose face pleased me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was anxious to test the skill of my cook, so I ordered her to get a good
      supper for me, and I gave her some money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some money,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and I will let you have the bill
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After taking away whatever I had left with Mengs I went to Don Diego&rsquo;s
      house, and to my astonishment found it empty. I went back and asked
      Philippe, my man, where Don Diego was staying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s some distance, sir; I will take you there tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is my landlord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the floor above; but they are very quiet people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is gone out and won&rsquo;t be home till ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At nine o&rsquo;clock I was told that my supper was ready. I was very hungry,
      and the neatness with which the table was laid was a pleasant surprise in
      Spain. I was sorry that I had had no opportunity of expressing my
      satisfaction to Don Diego, but I sat down to supper. Then indeed I thought
      the cobbler a hero; the Biscayan maid might have entered into rivalry with
      the best cook in France. There were five dishes, including my favourite
      delicacy &lsquo;las criadillas&rsquo;, and everything was exquisite. My lodging was
      dear enough, but the cook made the whole arrangement a wonderful bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of supper Philippe told me that the landlord had come in,
      and that with my leave he would wish me a good evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shew him in by all means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw Don Diego and his charming daughter enter; he had rented the house
      on purpose to be my landlord.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     My Amours With Donna Ignazia&mdash;Return of M. de Mocenino to
     Madrid
</pre>
    <p>
      All you barons, counts, and marquises who laugh at an untitled man who
      calls himself a gentleman, pause and reflect, spare your disdain till you
      have degraded him; allow him a gentle title so long as he does gentle
      deeds. Respect the man that defines nobility in a new way, which you
      cannot understand. With him nobility is not a series of descents from
      father to son; he laughs at pedigrees, in which no account is taken of the
      impure blood introduced by wifely infidelities; he defines a nobleman as
      one who does noble deeds, who neither lies nor cheats, who prefers his
      honour to his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      This latter part of the definition should make you tremble for your lives,
      if you meditate his dishonour. From imposture comes contempt, from
      contempt hatred, from hatred homicide, which takes out the blot of
      dishonour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cobbler Don Diego might have feared, perhaps, that I should laugh at
      him, when he told me he was noble; but feeling himself to be really so he
      had done his best to prove it to me. The fineness of his behaviour when I
      was in prison had given me some idea of the nobility of his soul, but he
      was not content with this. On the receipt of my letter, he had taken a new
      house only to give up the best part of it to me. No doubt he calculated on
      not losing in the long run, as after I had left he would probably have no
      difficulty in letting the apartment, but his chief motive was to oblige
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not disappointed; henceforth I treated him entirely as an equal.
      Donna Ignazia was delighted at what her father had done for me. We talked
      an hour, settling our business relations over a bottle of excellent wine.
      I succeeded in my contention that the Biscayan cook should be kept at my
      expense. All the same, I wanted the girl to think that she was in Don
      Diego&rsquo;s service, so I begged him to pay her every day, as I should take
      all my meals at home, at all events, till the return of the ambassador. I
      also told him that it was a penance to me to eat alone, and begged him to
      keep me company at dinner and supper every day. He tried to excuse
      himself, and at last gave in on the condition that his daughter should
      take his place when he had too much work to do. As may be imagined I had
      anticipated this condition, and made no difficulty about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, feeling curious to see the way in which my landlord was
      lodged, I paid him a visit. I went into the little room sacred to Donna
      Ignazia. A bed, a chest, and a chair made up the whole furniture; but
      beside the bed was a desk before a picture, four feet high, representing
      St. Ignatius de Loyola as a fine young man, more calculated to irritate
      the sense than to arouse devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      My cobbler said to me,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a much better lodging than I had before; and the rent of your room
      pays me for the house four times over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the furniture and the linen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will all be paid in the course of four years. I hope this house will
      be the dower of my daughter. It is an excellent speculation, and I have to
      thank you for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear it; but what is this, you seem to be making new boots?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so; but if you look you will see that I am working on a last which
      has been given me. In this way I have not to put them on, nor need I
      trouble myself whether they fit well or ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you get?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty reals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a larger price than usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but there&rsquo;s a great difference between my work and my leather, and
      the usual work and leather of the bootmakers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will have a last made, and you shall make me a pair of shoes, if
      you will; but I warn you they must be of the finest skin, and the soles of
      morocco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will cost more, and not last so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that; I can&rsquo;t bear any but the lightest boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I left him he said his daughter should dine with me that day as he
      was very busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I called on the Count of Aranda, who received me coldly, but with great
      politeness. I told him how I had been treated by my parish priest and by
      Mengs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard about it; this was worse than your imprisonment, and I don&rsquo;t know
      what I could have done for you if you had not communicated, and obliged
      the priest to take out your name. Just now they are trying to annoy me
      with posters on the walls, but I take no notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they want your excellency to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To allow long cloaks and low-crowned hats; you must know all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only arrived at Madrid yesterday evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Don&rsquo;t come here on Sunday, as my house is to be blown up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see that, my lord, so I will be in your hall at noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect you will be in good company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I duly went, and never had I seen it so full. The count was addressing the
      company, under the last poster threatening him with death, two very
      energetic lines were inscribed by the person who put up the poster,
      knowing that he was at the same time running his head into the noose:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Si me cogen, me horqueran,
     Pero no me cogeran.

   &ldquo;If they catch me, they will hang me,
   So I shall not let them catch me.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      At dinner Donna Ignazia told me how glad she was to have me in the house,
      but she did not respond to all my amorous speeches after Philippe had left
      the room. She blushed and sighed, and then being obliged to say something,
      begged me to forget everything that had passed between us. I smiled, and
      said that I was sure she knew she was asking an impossibility. I added
      that even if I could forget the past I would not do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew that she was neither false nor hypocritical, and felt sure that her
      behaviour proceeded from devotion; but I knew this could not last long. I
      should have to conquer her by slow degrees. I had had to do so with other
      devotees who had loved me less than she, nevertheless, they had
      capitulated. I was therefore sure of Donna Ignazia.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner she remained a quarter of an hour with me, but I refrained
      from any amorous attempts.
    </p>
    <p>
      After my siesta I dressed, and went out without seeing her. In the evening
      when she came in for her father, who had supped with me, I treated her
      with the greatest politeness without shewing any ill-humour. The following
      day I behaved in the same manner. At dinner she told me she had broken
      with her lover at the beginning of Lent, and begged me not to see him if
      he called on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Whit Sunday I called on the Count of Aranda, and Don Diego, who was
      exquisitely dressed, dined with me. I saw nothing of his daughter. I asked
      after her, and Don Diego replied, with a smile, that she had shut herself
      up in her room to celebrate the Feast of Pentecost. He pronounced these
      words in a manner and with a smile that he would not have dared to use if
      he had been speaking to a fellow-Spaniard. He added that she would, no
      doubt, come down and sup with me, as he was going to sup with his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Don Diego, don&rsquo;t let there be any false compliments between us.
      Before you go out, tell your daughter not to put herself out for me, and
      that I do not pretend to put my society in comparison with that of God.
      Tell her to keep her room to-night, and she can sup with me another time.
      I hope you will take my message to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will have it so, you shall be obeyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After my siesta, the worthy man said that Donna Ignazia thanked me and
      would profit by my kindness, as she did not want to see anyone on that
      holy day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad she has taken me at my word, and to-morrow I will thank
      her for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had some difficulty in shaping my lips to this reply; for this excess of
      devotion displeased me, and even made me tremble for her love. I could not
      help laughing, however, when Don Diego said that a wise father forgives an
      ecstasy of love. I had not expected such a philosophic remark from the
      mouth of a Spaniard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was unpleasant, so I resolved to stay indoors. I told Philippe
      that I should not want the carriage, and that he could go out. I told my
      Biscayan cook that I should not sup till ten. When I was alone I wrote for
      some time, and in the evening the mother lit my candles, instead of the
      daughter, so in the end I went to bed without any supper. At nine o&rsquo;clock
      next morning, just as I was awaking, Donna Ignazia appeared, to my great
      astonishment, telling me how sorry she was to hear that I had not taken
      any supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone, sad, and unhappy,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I felt that abstinence was the best
      thing for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look downcast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You alone can make me look cheerful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here my barber came in, and she left me. I then went to mass at the Church
      of the Good Success, where I saw all the handsome courtezans in Madrid. I
      dined with Don Diego, and when his daughter came in with dessert he told
      her that it was her fault I had gone supperless to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall not happen again,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to come with me to our Lady of Atocha?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like it very much,&rdquo; she replied, with a side-glance at her
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My girl,&rdquo; said Don Diego, &ldquo;true devotion and merriment go together, and
      the reason is that the truly devout person has trust in God and in the
      honesty of all men. Thus you can trust in Don Jaime as an honest man,
      though he has not the good fortune to be born in Spain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not help laughing at this last sentence, but Don Diego was not
      offended. Donna Ignazia kissed her father&rsquo;s hands, and asked if she might
      bring her cousin too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to take the cousin for?&rdquo; said Don Diego; &ldquo;I will answer
      for Don Jaime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, Don Diego, but if Ignazia likes her cousin to come I
      shall be delighted, provided it be the elder cousin, whom I like better
      than the younger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this arrangement the father went his way, and I sent Philippe to the
      stables to put in four mules.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we were alone Ignazia asked me repentantly to forgive her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Entirely, if you will forgive me for loving you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, dearest! I think I shall go mad if I keep up the battle any
      longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There needs no battle, dearest Ignazia, either love me as I love you, or
      tell me to leave the house, and see you no more. I will obey you, but that
      will not make you happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that. No, you shall not go from your own house. But allow me to
      tell you that you are mistaken in your estimate of my cousins&rsquo; characters.
      I know what influenced you, but you do not know all. The younger is a good
      girl, and though she is ugly, she too has succumbed to love. But the
      elder, who is ten times uglier, is mad with rage at never having had a
      lover. She thought she had made you in love with her, and yet she speaks
      evil of you. She reproaches me for having yielded so easily and boasts
      that she would never have gratified your passion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more, we must punish her; and the younger shall come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am much obliged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she know that we love each other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never told her, but she has guessed it, and pities me. She wants
      me to join her in a devotion to Our Lady de la Soledad, the effect of
      which would be a complete cure for us both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she is in love, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and she is unhappy in her love, for it is not returned. That must be
      a great grief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pity her, and yet, with such a face, I do not know any man who would
      take compassion on her. The poor girl would do well to leave love alone.
      But as to you. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say nothing about me: my danger is greater than hers. I am forced to
      defend myself or to give in, and God knows there are some men whom it is
      impossible to ward off! God is my witness that in Holy Week I went to a
      poor girl with the smallpox, and touched her in the hope of catching it,
      and so losing my beauty; but God would not have it so, and my confessor
      blamed me, bidding me to do a penance I had never expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me that a handsome face is the index of a handsome soul, and is a
      gift of God, for which a woman should render thanks continually; that in
      attempting to destroy this beauty I had sinned, for I had endeavoured to
      destroy God&rsquo;s handiwork. After a good deal of rebuke in this style, he
      ordered me to put a little rouge on my cheeks whenever I felt myself
      looking pale. I had to submit, and I have bought a pot of rouge, but
      hitherto I have not felt obliged to use it. Indeed, my father might notice
      it, and I should not like to tell him that it is done by way of penance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your confessor a young man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is an old man of seventy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you tell him all your sins without reserve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, for the smallest circumstance may be really a great sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he ask you questions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, for he sees that I am telling him the whole truth. It is a great
      trial, but I have to submit to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had this confessor for long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For two years. Before him I had a confessor who was quite unbearable. He
      asked me questions which made me quite indignant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What questions were these?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must please excuse me telling you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you go to confession so often?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Would to God I had not good cause! but after all I only go once a
      week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, for when I am in mortal sin I cannot sleep at night. I am afraid
      of dying in my sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pity you, dearest; I have a consolation which is denied you. I have an
      infinite trust in the infinite mercy of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cousin arrived and we set out. We found a good many carriages in front
      of the church-door, and the church itself was full of devotees, both male
      and female. Amongst others I saw the Duchess of Villadorias, notorious for
      her andromania. When the &lsquo;furor uterinus&rsquo; seized her, nothing could keep
      her back. She would rush at the man who had excited her, and he had no
      choice but to satisfy her passion. This had happened several times in
      public assemblies, and had given rise to some extraordinary scenes. I had
      seen her at a ball; she was still both young and pretty. As I entered the
      church I saw her kneeling on the stones of the church floor. She lifted
      her eyes, and gazed at me, as if doubtful whether she knew me or not, as
      she had only seen me in domino. After my devotees had prayed for half an
      hour, they rose to go, and the duchess rose also; and as soon as we were
      out of the church she asked me if I knew her. I replied in the
      affirmative, and she asked why I had not been to see her, and if I visited
      the Duchess of Benevento. I told her that I did not visit her grace, and
      that I should have the honour of paying her a call before long.
    </p>
    <p>
      On our way I explained to my two companions the nature of the duchess&rsquo;s
      malady. Donna Ignazia asked me anxiously if I really meant to go and see
      her. She seemed reassured when I replied in the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      A common and to my mind a ridiculous question is which of the two sexes
      enjoys the generative act the more. Homer gives us Jupiter and Juno
      disputing on this point. Tiresias, who was once a woman, has given a
      correct though amusing decision on the point. A laconic answer has it that
      a woman enjoys the act the most because with her it is sharper, repeated
      more frequently, and finally because the battle is fought in her field.
      She is at the same time an active and passive agent, while action is
      indispensable to the pleasure of the man. But the most conclusive reason
      is that if the woman&rsquo;s pleasure were not the greater nature would be
      unjust, and she never is or can be unjust. Nothing in this universe is
      without its use, and no pleasure or pain is without its compensation or
      balance. If woman had not more pleasure than man she would not have more
      organs than he. The greater nervous power planted in the female organ is
      demonstrated by the andromania to which some women are subject, and which
      makes them either Messalines or martyrs. Men have nothing at all similar
      to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nature has given to women this special enjoyment to compensate for the
      pains they have to undergo. What man would expose himself, for the
      pleasure he enjoys, to the pains of pregnancy and the dangers of childbed?
      But women will do so again and again; so it must be concluded that they
      believe the pleasure to outbalance the pain; and so it is clearly the
      woman who has the better share in the enjoyment. In spite of this, if I
      had the choice of being born again as a woman, I should say no; for in
      spite of my voluptuousness, a man has pleasures which a woman cannot
      enjoy. Though, indeed, rather than not be born again, I would be a woman,
      and even a brute, provided always that I had my memory, for without it I
      should no longer be myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had some ices, and my two companions returned home with me, well
      pleased with the enjoyment I had given them without offending God. Donna
      Ignazia, who was delighted with my continence during the day, and
      apparently afraid of its not lasting, begged me to invite her cousin to
      supper. I agreed, and even did so with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cousin was ugly, and also a fool, but she had a great heart and was
      sympathetic. I knew that Donna Ignazia had told her all, and as she was no
      restraint on me I did not mind her being at supper, while Ignazia looked
      upon her as a safeguard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table had been laid for three, when I heard a step coming up the
      stairs. It was the father, and I asked him to sup with us. Don Diego was a
      pleasant man, as I have said, but what amused me most of all about him was
      his moral maxims. He knew or suspected that I was fond of his daughter,
      though in an honourable way; he thought my honour or his daughter&rsquo;s piety
      would be a sufficient safeguard. If he had suspected what had really
      happened, I do not think he would ever have allowed us to be together.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat beside his niece and facing his daughter, and did most of the
      talking, for your Spaniard, though grave, is eloquent, and fond of hearing
      the fine harmonies of his native tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very hot, so I asked him to take off his waistcoat, and to tell his
      daughter to do just as she would if only he and his wife had been present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Ignazia had not to be entreated long before she took off her
      kerchief, but the poor cousin did not like having to shew us her bones and
      swarthy skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Ignazia told her father how much she had enjoyed herself, and how
      they had seen the Duchess of Villadorias, who had asked me to come and see
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good man began to philosophise and to jest on her malady, and he told
      me some stories, germane to the question, which the girls pretended not to
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good wine of La Mancha kept us at table till a late hour, and the time
      seemed to pass very quickly. Don Diego told his niece that she could sleep
      with his daughter, in the room we were in, as the bed was big enough for
      two. I hastened to add that if the ladies would do so I should be
      delighted; but Donna Ignazia blushed and said it would not do, as the room
      was only separated from mine by a glass door. At this I smiled at Don
      Diego, who proceeded to harangue his daughter in a manner which amused me
      extremely. He told her that I was at least twenty years older than
      herself, and that in suspecting me she had committed a greater sin than if
      she allowed me to take some slight liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that when you go to confession next Sunday you
      will forget to accuse yourself of having wrongfully suspected Don Jaime of
      a dishonourable action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Donna Ignazia looked at me affectionately, asked my pardon, and said she
      would do whatever her father liked. The cousin said nothing, and the
      father kissed his daughter, bade me a good night, and went away well
      pleased with the harangue he had delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suspected that Donna Ignazia expected me to make some attempt on her
      honour, and feeling sure that she would resist for the sake of appearance,
      I determined to leave her in peace. Next morning I got up and went into
      their room in the hope of playing some trick on them. However, the birds
      were flown, and I had no doubt that they had gone to hear mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Ignazia came home by herself at ten o&rsquo;clock. She found me alone,
      dressed, and writing. She told me she had been in the church for three
      hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been to confession, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I went last Sunday, and I shall wait till next Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad that your confession will not be lengthened by any sins I
      have helped you to commit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong? I understand; but you must know that I am not going to be damned
      for mere desires. I do not wish to torment you or to become a martyr
      myself. What you granted me has made me fall deeply in love with you, and
      it makes me shudder when I imagine that our love has become a subject of
      repentance with you. I have had a bad night; and it is time for me to
      think of my health. I must forget you, but to bring about that effect I
      will see you no longer. I will keep on the house, but I will not live in
      it. If your religion is an intelligent one, you will approve of my idea.
      Tell your confessor of it next Sunday, and you will see that he will
      approve it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, but I cannot agree to it. You can go away if you like, and
      I shall say nothing, but I shall be the most unhappy girl in all Madrid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke these words, two big tears rolled down her cheeks, and her
      face dropped; I was profoundly moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you, dearest Ignazia, and I hope not to be damned for my love. I
      cannot see you without loving you and to this love some positive proof is
      essential; otherwise, I am unhappy. If I go you say you will be unhappy,
      and if I stay it is I that will be unhappy, my health will be ruined. But
      tell me which I shall do stay or go? Say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must be as loving and tender as you were before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! I promised to commit that sin no more. I tell you to stay, because
      I am sure that in eight or ten days we shall have become so accustomed to
      one another that I shall be able to love you like a father, and you will
      be able to take me in your arms without any amorous sentiments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dearest, quite sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me be mistaken, and believe me I shall be glad to be mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy devotee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why unhappy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, nothing. I may be too long, I shall endanger . . . let us say no
      more about it. I will stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went out more pained with her state than my own, and I felt that the
      best thing I could do would be to forget her, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; said I to myself,
      &ldquo;even if I do enjoy her once, Sunday will come again; she will confess,
      repent, and I shall have to begin all over again. She confessed her love,
      and flatters herself that she will be able to subdue it&mdash;a foolish
      hope, which could only exist in a mind under the dominion of prejudice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I came home at noon, and Don Diego dined with me; his daughter did not
      appear till the dessert. I begged her to sit down, politely, but coldly.
      Her father asked her jestingly if I had paid her a visit in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never suspected Don Jaime of such a thing,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and I only
      objected out of shyness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I interrupted her by praising her modesty, and telling her that she would
      have done quite right to beware of me, if my sense of duty had not been
      stronger than any voluptuous desires inspired by her charms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Diego pronounced this declaration of love as good as anything to be
      found in the &ldquo;Morte d&rsquo;Arthur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His daughter said I was laughing at her, but Don Diego said he was certain
      that I was in earnest, and that I had known her before taking her to the
      ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are utterly mistaken,&rdquo; said Donna Ignazia, with some degree of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father is wiser than you, senora,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! How and when did you see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the church where I heard mass, and you communicated, when you went out
      with your cousin. I followed you at some distance; you can guess the
      rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was speechless, and her father enjoyed the consciousness of his
      superior intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to see the bull fight,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a fine day, and all
      Madrid will be there, so one must go early to get a good place. I advise
      you to go, as you have never seen a bull fight; ask Don Jaime to take you
      with him, Ignazia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to have my companionship?&rdquo; said she, tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I would, but you must bring your cousin, as I am in love with
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Diego burst out laughing, but Ignazia said, slyly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not so impossible after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We went to see the splendid but barbarous spectacle in which Spaniards
      take so much delight. The two girls placed themselves in front of the only
      vacant box, and I sat behind on the second bench, which was a foot and a
      half higher than the first. There were already two ladies there, and much
      to my amusement one of them was the famous Duchess of Villadorias. She was
      in front of me, and sat in such a position that her head was almost
      between my legs. She recognized me, and said we were fortunate in meeting
      one another; and then noticing Donna Ignazia, who was close to her, she
      congratulated me in French on her charms, and asked me whether she was my
      mistress or my wife. I replied that she was a beauty before whom I sighed
      in vain. She replied, with a smile, that she was rather a sceptical
      person; and turning to Donna Ignazia began a pleasant and amorous
      discourse, thinking the girl to be as learned in the laws of love as
      herself. She whispered something in her ear which made Ignazia blush, and
      the duchess, becoming enthusiastic, told me I had chosen the handsomest
      girl in Madrid, and that she would be delighted to see us both at her
      country house.
    </p>
    <p>
      I promised to come, as I was obliged to do, but I begged to be excused
      naming the day. Nevertheless, she made me promise to call on her at four
      o&rsquo;clock the next day, telling me, much to my terror, that she would be
      alone. She was pretty enough, but too notorious a character; and such a
      visit would have given rise to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily the fight began, and silence became general, for the Spaniards are
      passionately devoted of bull fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much has been written on the subject that my readers will pardon my
      giving a detailed account of the fight. I may say that the sport is, in my
      opinion, a most barbarous one, and likely to operate unfavourably on the
      national morals; the arena is sometimes drenched in the blood of bulls,
      horses, and even of the unfortunate picadores and matadores, whose sole
      defence is the red rag with which they irritate the bull.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was over I escorted the girls&mdash;who had enjoyed themselves
      immensely&mdash;back to the house, and made the ugly cousin stay to
      supper, as I foresaw that they would again sleep together.
    </p>
    <p>
      We supped together, but it was a melancholy affair, for Don Diego was
      away, and I did not feel in the humour to amuse my company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Ignazia became pensive when, in reply to a question of hers, I said
      that it would be absolutely rude of me not to go to the duchess&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come with me some day,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;to dine at her country house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not look for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she is a madwoman. She talked to me in a way that would have
      offended me if I did not know that she fancied she was honouring me by
      laying aside her rank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We rose from table, and after I had dismissed my man we sat on the balcony
      to wait for Don Diego and to enjoy the delicious evening breezes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we sat near to each other in the twilight, so favourable to lovers&rsquo;
      vows, I looked into Donna Ignazia&rsquo;s eyes, and saw there that my hour had
      come. I clasped her to me with one arm, I clung with my lips to hers, and
      by the way she trembled I guessed the flame which consumed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go and see the duchess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, if you will promise me not to go to confession next Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what will he say if I do not go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all, if he understands his business. But let us talk it over a
      little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were so tightly clasped together that the cousin, like a good girl,
      left us, and went to the other end of the balcony, taking care to look
      away from us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without changing my position, in spite of the temptation to do so, I asked
      her if she felt in the humour to repent of the sin she was ready to
      commit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not thinking of repentance just then, but as you remind me of it, I
      must tell you that I shall certainly go to confession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after you have been to confession will you love me as you love me
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope God will give me strength to offend Him no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you that if you continue loving me God will not give you grace,
      yet I feel sure that on Sunday evening you will refuse me that which you
      are now ready to grant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I will, sweetheart; but why should we talk of that now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because if I abandon myself to pleasure now I shall be more in love with
      you than ever, and consequently more unhappy than ever, when the day of
      your repentance comes. So promise me that you will not go to confession
      whilst I remain at Madrid, or give the fatal order now, and bid me leave
      you. I cannot abandon myself to love to-day knowing that it will be
      refused me on Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I remonstrated thus, I clasped her affectionately in my arms, caressing
      her most ardently; but before coming to the decisive action I asked her
      again whether she would promise not to go to confession next Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are cruel,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I cannot make you that promise for my
      conscience sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this reply, which I had quite expected, I remained motionless, feeling
      sure that she must be in a state of desperate irritation at the work half
      begun and not concluded. I, too, suffered, for I was at the door of the
      sanctuary, and a slight movement would have sent me into the inmost
      shrine; but I knew that her torments must be greater than mine, and that
      she could not resist long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Ignazia was indeed in a terrible state; I had not repulsed her, but
      I was perfectly inactive. Modesty prevented her asking me openly to
      continue, but she redoubled her caresses, and placed herself in an easier
      position, reproaching me with my cruelty. I do not know whether I could
      have held out much longer, but just then the cousin turned round and told
      us that Don Diego was coming in.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hastened to arrange our toilette, and to sit in a decent position. The
      cousin came up to us, and Don Diego, after making a few remarks, left us
      on the balcony, wishing us a good night. I might have begun over again,
      but I clung to my system of repression, and after wishing the girls good
      night with a melancholy air, I went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hoped Donna Ignazia would repent and come and keep me company, but I was
      disappointed. They left their room early in the morning, and at noon Don
      Diego came to dine with me, saying his daughter had such a bad headache
      that she had not even gone to mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must get her to eat something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I think abstinence will do her good, and in the evening I daresay she
      will be able to sup with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went to keep her company by her bedside after I had taken my siesta. I
      did my best for three hours to convince her of her folly; but she kept her
      eyes closed, and said nothing, only sighing when I said something very
      touching.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left her to walk in St. Jerome&rsquo;s Park, and told her that if she did not
      sup with me I should understand that she did not wish to see me again.
      This threat had its effect. She came to table at supper-time, but she
      looked pale and exhausted. She ate little, and said nothing, for she knew
      not what to say. I saw that she was suffering, and I pitied her from my
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before going to bed she asked me if I had been to see the duchess. She
      seemed somewhat cheered when I answered in the negative. I told her that
      she might satisfy herself of the truth of my reply by asking Philippe, who
      had taken my note begging her grace to excuse me for that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will you go another day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dearest, because I see it would grieve you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a sigh of content, and I embraced her gently, and she left me as
      sad as I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could see that what I asked of her was a great deal; but I had good
      grounds for hope, as I knew her ardent disposition. It was not God and I
      that were disputing for her, but her confessor and I. If she had not been
      a Catholic I should have won her the first day.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had told me that she would get into trouble with her confessor if she
      did not go to him as usual; she had too much of fine Spanish honour in her
      to tell him what was not true, or to endeavour to combine her love with
      her religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Friday and the Saturday passed without any events of consequence. Her
      father, who could not blind himself to our love any longer, trusted, I
      suppose, to his daughter&rsquo;s virtue, and made her dine and sup with me every
      day. On Saturday evening Donna Ignazia left me sadder than ever, and
      turned her head away when I would have kissed her as usual. I saw what was
      the matter; she was going to communicate the next day. I admired her
      consistency, in spite of myself, and pitied her heartily; for I could
      guess the storm that must be raging in her breast. I began to repent
      having demanded all, and wished I had been contented with a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wished to be satisfied with my own eyes, and got up early on Sunday
      morning and followed her. I knew that she would call for her cousin, so I
      went on to the church. I placed myself by the sacristy-door, where I could
      see without being seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited a quarter of an hour, then they came in, and after kneeling down
      for a few moments, separated, each going to her own confessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I only noticed Donna Ignazia; I saw her going to the confessional, and the
      confessor turning towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited patiently. I thought the confession would never come to an end.
      &ldquo;What is he saying?&rdquo; I repeated to myself as I saw the confessor speaking
      to her now and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could bear it no longer, and I was on the point of going away when I saw
      her rise from her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Ignazia, looking like a saint, came to kneel in the church, but out
      of my sight. I thought she would come forward to receive the Holy
      Communion at the end of the Mass that was being said, but instead of that
      she went towards the door, rejoined her cousin and they left the church. I
      was astonished. My heart was seized with a pang of remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; I said to myself. &ldquo;The poor girl has made a sincere and
      full confession, she has avowed her love, and the priest&rsquo;s cruel duty has
      made him refuse her absolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is lost. What will come of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My peace of mind and hers require me to leave her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretch that I am, to have lost all for all! I should have made allowance
      for the peculiar Spanish character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have enjoyed her by surprise now and again; the difficulty would
      have added piquancy to the intrigue. I have behaved as if I were once more
      twenty, and I have lost all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At dinner she will be all sad and tearful. I must find some way out of
      this terrible situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus soliloquising, I came home ill pleased with the line of conduct I had
      adopted.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hairdresser was waiting for me, but I sent him away, and told my cook
      not to serve my dinner till I ordered it; then, feeling the need of rest,
      I flung myself on my bed and slept profoundly till one o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got up and ordered dinner to be brought in, and sent a message to the
      father and daughter that I was expecting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      My surprise may be imagined when Donna Ignazia appeared in a costume of
      black velvet, adorned with ribbons and lace. In my opinion there is no
      more seductive costume in Europe when the wearer is pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also noticed that every feature of her face breathed peace and calm; I
      had never seen her looking so well, and I could not help congratulating
      her. She replied with a smile, and I gave her a kiss, which she took as
      meekly as a lamb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippe arrived, and we sat down to table. I saw that my fair sweetheart
      had crossed the Rubicon; the day was won.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to be happy,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but let us say nothing, and it will
      come of itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, I did not conceal my bliss, and made love to her whenever the
      servant was out of the room. She was not only submissive, but even ardent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we left the table she asked me if I still loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than ever, darling; I adore you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take me to the bull fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick! Fetch the hairdresser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When my hair was done I made an elaborate toilette, and burning with
      impatience we set out on foot, as I was afraid we should not secure a good
      place if we waited till the carriage was ready. We found a fine box with
      only two persons in it, and Ignazia, after glancing round, said she was
      glad that the detestable duchess was not anywhere near us.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some fine sport my mistress begged me to take her to the Prado,
      where all the best people in Madrid are to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Ignazia leant on my arm, seemed proud to be thought mine, and filled
      me with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once we met the Venetian ambassador and his favourite, Manucci.
      They had just arrived from Aranjuez. We greeted each other with due
      Spanish politeness, and the ambassador paid me a high compliment on the
      beauty of my companion. Donna Ignazia pretended not to understand, but she
      pressed my arm with Spanish delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      After walking a short distance with us M. de Mocenigo said he hoped I
      would dine with him on the following day, and after I had nodded
      acquiescence in the French style we parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the evening we took some ices and returned home, and the gentle
      pressure of my arm on the way prepared me for the bliss I was to enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found Don Diego on the balcony waiting for us. He congratulated his
      daughter on her pleasant appearance and the pleasure she must have taken
      in my society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charmed with papa&rsquo;s good humour, I asked him to sup with us, and he
      accepted, and amused us with his witty conversation and a multitude of
      little tales that pleased me exceedingly. He made the following speech on
      leaving us, which I give word for word, but I cannot give the reader any
      idea of the inimitable Spanish gravity with which it was delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amigo Senior Don Jaime, I leave you here to enjoy the cool air with my
      daughter. I am delighted at your loving her, and you may be assured that I
      shall place no obstacle in the way of your becoming my son-in-law as soon
      as you can shew your titles of nobility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he was gone, I said to his daughter,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be only too happy, if it could be managed; but you must know
      that in my country they only are called nobles who have an hereditary
      right to rule the state. If I had been born in Spain I should be noble,
      but as it is I adore you, and I hope you will make me happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dearest, but we must be happy together; I cannot suffer any
      infidelity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you my word of honour that I will be wholly faithful to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come then, &lsquo;corazon mio&rsquo;, let us go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, let us put out the lights, and stay here a quarter of an hour. Tell
      me, my angel, whence comes this unexpected happiness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You owe it to a piece of tyranny which drove me to desperation. God is
      good, and I am sure He would not have me become my own executioner. When I
      told my confessor that I could not help loving you, but that I could
      restrain myself from all excess of love, he replied that this
      self-confidence was misplaced, as I had already fallen. He wanted me to
      promise never to be alone with you again, and on my refusing to do so he
      would not give me absolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never had such a piece of shame cast on me, but I laid it all in
      the hands of God, and said, &lsquo;Thy will be done.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whilst I heard mass my mind was made up, and as long as you love me I
      shall be yours, and yours only. When you leave Spain and abandon me to
      despair, I shall find another confessor. My conscience holds me guiltless;
      this is my comfort. My cousin, whom I have told all, is astonished, but
      then she is not very clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this declaration, which put me quite at my ease, and would have
      relieved me of any scruples if I had had them, I took her to my bed. In
      the morning, she left me tired out, but more in love with her than ever.

      If these Memoirs, only written to console me in the dreadful weariness
      which is slowly killing me in Bohemia&mdash;and which, perhaps, would kill
      me anywhere, since, though my body is old, my spirit and my desires are as
      young as ever&mdash;if these Memoirs are ever read, I repeat, they will
      only be read when I am gone, and all censure will be lost on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, seeing that men are divided into two sections, the one and
      by far the greater composed of the ignorant and superficial, and the other
      of the learned and reflective, I beg to state that it is to the latter I
      would appeal. Their judgment, I believe, will be in favour of my veracity,
      and, indeed, why should I not be veracious? A man can have no object in
      deceiving himself, and it is for myself that I chiefly write.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto I have spoken nothing but the truth, without considering whether
      the truth is in my favour or no. My book is not a work of dogmatic
      theology, but I do not think it will do harm to anyone; while I fancy that
      those who know how to imitate the bee and to get honey from every flower
      will be able to extract some good from the catalogue of my vices and
      virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this digression (it may be too long, but that is my business and
      none other&rsquo;s), I must confess that never have I had so unpleasant a truth
      to set down as that which I am going to relate. I committed a fatal act of
      indiscretion&mdash;an act which after all these years still gives my heart
      a pang as I think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after my conquest I dined with the Venetian ambassador, and I had
      the pleasure of hearing that all the ministers and grandees with whom I
      had associated had the highest possible opinion of me. In three or four
      days the king, the royal family, and the ministers would return to town,
      and I expected to have daily conferences with the latter respecting the
      colony in the Sierra Morena, where I should most probably be going.
      Manucci, who continued to treat me as a valued friend, proposed to
      accompany me on my journey, and would bring with him an adventuress, who
      called herself Porto-Carrero, pretending to be the daughter or niece of
      the late cardinal of that name, and thus obtained a good deal of
      consideration; though in reality she was only the mistress of the French
      consul at Madrid, the Abbe Bigliardi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the promising state of my prospects when my evil genius brought
      to Madrid a native of Liege, Baron de Fraiture, chief huntsman of the
      principality, and a profligate, a gamester, and a cheat, like all those
      who proclaim their belief in his honesty nowadays.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had unfortunately met him at Spa, and told him I was was going to
      Portugal. He had come after me, hoping to use me as a means of getting
      into good society, and of filling his pocket with the money of the dupes
      he aspired to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gamesters have never had any proof of my belonging to their infernal
      clique, but they have always persisted in believing that I too am a
      &ldquo;Greek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as this baron heard that I was in Madrid he called on me, and by
      dint of politeness obliged me to receive him. I thought any small
      civilities I might shew or introductions I might give could do me no harm.
      He had a travelling companion to whom he introduced me. He was a fat,
      ignorant fellow, but a Frenchman, and therefore agreeable. A Frenchman who
      knows how to present himself, who is well dressed, and has the society
      air, is usually accepted without demur or scrutiny. He had been a cavalry
      captain, but had been fortunate enough to obtain an everlasting furlough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four or five days after his appearance the baron asked me quietly enough
      to lend him a score of louis, as he was hard up. I replied as quietly,
      thanking him for treating me as a friend, but informing him that I really
      could not lend him the money, as I wanted what little I had for my own
      necessities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can do good business together, and you cannot possibly be
      moneyless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know anything about good business, but I do know that I want my
      money and cannot part with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are at our wits&rsquo; end to quiet our landlord; come and speak to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were to do so I should do you more harm than good. He would ask me
      if I would answer for you, and I should reply that you are one of those
      noblemen who stand in need of no surety. All the same, the landlord would
      think that if I did not stand your surety, it must be from my entertaining
      doubts as to your solvency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had introduced Fraiture to Count Manucci, on the Pando, and he requested
      me to take him to see the count, to which request I was foolish enough to
      accede.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later the baron opened his soul to Manucci.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the Venetian disposed to be obliging, but wary. He refused to
      lend money himself, but introduced the baron to someone who lent him money
      on pledges without interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron and his friend did a little gaming and won a little money, but I
      held aloof from them to the best of my ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had my colony and Donna Ignazia, and wanted to live peacefully; and if I
      had spent a single night away from home, the innocent girl would have been
      filled with alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      About that time M. de Mocenigo went as ambassador to France, and was
      replaced by M. Querini. Querini was a man of letters, while Mocenigo only
      liked music and his own peculiar kind of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new ambassador was distinctly favourable to me, and in a few days I
      had reason to believe that he would do more for me than ever Mocenigo
      would have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, the baron and his friend began to think of beating a
      retreat to France. There was no gaming at the ambassador&rsquo;s and no gaming
      at the Court; they must return to France, but they owed money to their
      landlord, and they wanted money for the journey. I could give them
      nothing, Manucci would give them nothing; we both pitied them, but our
      duty to ourselves made us cruel to everyone else. However, he brought
      trouble on us.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning Manucci came to see me in evident perturbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know exactly. For the last week I have refused to see the Baron
      Fraiture, as not being able to give him money, his presence only wearied
      me. He has written me a letter, in which he threatens to blow out his
      brains to-day if I will not lend him a hundred pistoles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said the same thing to me three days ago; but I replied that I would
      bet two hundred pistoles that he would do nothing of the kind. This made
      him angry, and he proposed to fight a duel with me; but I declined on the
      plea that as he was a desperate man either he would have an advantage over
      me or I, over him. Give him the same answer, or, better still, no answer
      at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot follow your advice. Here are the hundred pistoles. Take them to
      him and get a receipt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I admired his generosity and agreed to carry out his commission. I called
      on the baron, who seemed rather uncomfortable when I walked in; but
      considering his position I was not at all surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      I informed him that I was the bearer of a thousand francs from Count
      Manucci, who thereby placed him in a position to arrange his affairs and
      to leave Madrid. He received the money without any signs of pleasure,
      surprise, or gratitude, and wrote out the receipt. He assured me that he
      and his friend would start for Barcelona and France on the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then took the document to Manucci, who was evidently suffering from some
      mental trouble; and I remained to dinner with the ambassador. It was for
      the last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days after I went to dine with the ambassadors (for they all dined
      together), but to my astonishment the porter told me that he had received
      orders not to admit me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of this sentence on me was like that of a thunderbolt; I
      returned home like a man in a dream. I immediately sat down and wrote to
      Manucci, asking him why I had been subjected to such an insult; but
      Philippe, my man, brought me back the letter unopened.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was another surprise; I did not know what to expect next. &ldquo;What can
      be the matter?&rdquo; I said to myself. &ldquo;I cannot imagine, but I will have an
      explanation, or perish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I dined sadly with Donna Ignazia, without telling her the cause of my
      trouble, and just as I was going to take my siesta a servant of Manucci&rsquo;s
      brought me a letter from his master and fled before I could read it. The
      letter contained an enclosure which I read first. It was from Baron de
      Fraiture. He asked Manucci to lend him a hundred pistoles, promising to
      shew him the man whom he held for his dearest friend to be his worst
      enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manucci (honouring me, by the way, with the title of ungrateful traitor)
      said that the baron&rsquo;s letter had excited his curiosity and he had met him
      in St. Jerome&rsquo;s Park, where the baron had clearly proved this enemy to be
      myself, since I had informed the baron that though the name of Manucci was
      genuine the title of count was quite apocryphal.
    </p>
    <p>
      After recapitulating the information which Fraiture had given him, and
      which could only have proceeded from myself, he advised me to leave Madrid
      as soon as possible, in a week at latest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can give the reader no idea of the shock this letter gave me. For the
      first time in my life I had to confess myself guilty of folly,
      ingratitude, and crime. I felt that my fault was beyond forgiveness, and
      did not think of asking Manucci to pardon me; I could do nothing but
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, in spite of Manucci&rsquo;s just indignation, I could not help
      seeing that he had made a great mistake in advising me, in so insulting a
      manner, to leave Madrid in a week. The young man might have known that my
      self-respect would forbid my following such a piece of advice. He could
      not compel me to obey his counsel or command; and to leave Madrid would
      have been to commit a second baseness worse than the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      A prey to grief I spent the day without taking any steps one way or the
      other, and I went to bed without supping and without the company of Donna
      Ignazia.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a sound sleep I got up and wrote to the friend whom I had offended a
      sincere and humble confession of my fault. I concluded my letter by saying
      that I hoped that this evidence of my sincere and heartfelt repentance
      would suffice, but if not that I was ready to give him any honourable
      satisfaction in my power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;have me assassinated if you like, but I shall not
      leave Madrid till its suits me to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I put a commonplace seal on my letter, and had the address written by
      Philippe, whose hand was unknown to Manucci, and then I sent it to Pando
      where the king had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I kept my room the whole day; and Donna Ignazia, seeing that I had
      recovered my spirits to some degree, made no more enquiries about the
      cause of my distress. I waited in the whole of the next day, expecting a
      reply, but in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third day, being Sunday, I went out to call on the Prince della
      Catolica. My carriage stopped at his door, but the porter came out and
      told me in a polite whisper that his highness had his reasons for not
      receiving me any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an unexpected blow, but after it I was prepared for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drove to the Abbe Bigliardi, but the lackey, after taking in my name,
      informed me that his master was out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got into my carriage and went to Varnier, who said he wanted to speak to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into my carriage,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we will go and hear mass together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On our way he told me that the Venetian ambassador, Mocenigo, had warned
      the Duke of Medina Sidonia that I was a dangerous character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The duke,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;replied that he would cease to know you as soon as
      he found out the badness of your character himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These three shocks, following in such quick succession, cast me into a
      state of confusion. I said nothing till we heard mass together, but I
      believe that if I had not then told him the whole story I should have had
      an apoplectic fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varnier pitied me, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such are the ways of the great when they have abjured all virtue and
      honesty. Nevertheless, I advise you to keep silence about it, unless you
      would irritate Manucci still farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I got home I wrote to Manucci begging him to suspend his vengeance,
      or else I should be obliged to tell the story to all those who insulted me
      for the ambassador&rsquo;s sake. I sent the letter to M. Soderini, the secretary
      of the embassy, feeling sure that he would forward it to Manucci.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dined with my mistress, and took her to the bull fight, where I chanced
      to find myself in a box adjoining that in which Manucci and the two
      ambassadors were seated. I made them a bow which they were obliged to
      return, and did not vouchsafe them another glance for the rest of the
      spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the Marquis Grimaldi refused to receive me, and I saw that I
      should have to abandon all hope. The Duke of Lossada remained my friend on
      account of his dislike to the ambassador and his unnatural tastes; but he
      told me that he had been requested not to receive me, and that he did not
      think I had the slightest chance of obtaining any employment at Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could scarcely believe in such an extremity of vengeance: Manucci was
      making a parade of the influence he possessed over his wife the
      ambassador. In his insane desire for revenge he had laid all shame aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was curious to know whether he had forgotten Don Emmanuel de Roda and
      the Marquis de la Moras; I found both of them had been forewarned against
      me. There was still the Count of Aranda, and I was just going to see him
      when a servant of his highness&rsquo;s came and told me that his master wished
      to see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shuddered, for in my then state of mind I drew the most sinister
      conclusions from the message.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the great man alone, looking perfectly calm. This made me pluck up
      a heart. He asked me to sit down&mdash;a favour he had not hitherto done
      me, and this further contributed to cheer me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing to offend your ambassador?&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, I have done nothing to him directly, but by an inexcusable act
      of stupidity I have wounded his dear friend Manucci in his tenderest part.
      With the most innocent intentions I reposed my confidence in a cowardly
      fellow, who sold it to Manucci for a hundred pistoles. In his irritation,
      Manucci has stirred up the great man against me: &lsquo;hinc illae lacrimae&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been unwise, but what is done is done. I am sorry for you,
      because there is an end to all your hopes of advancement. The first thing
      the king would do would be to make enquiries about you of the ambassador.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel it to my sorrow, my lord, but must I leave Madrid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The ambassador did his best to make me send you way, but I told him
      that I had no power over you so long as you did not infringe the laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He has calumniated a Venetian subject whom I am bound to protect,&rsquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In that case,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;you can resort to the ordinary law, and
      punish him to the best of your ability.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ambassador finally begged me to order you not to mention the matter
      to any Venetian subjects at Madrid, and I think you can safely promise me
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, I have much pleasure in giving your excellency my word of honour
      not to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Then you can stay at Madrid as long as you please; and,
      indeed, Mocenigo will be leaving in the course of a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From that moment I made up my mind to amuse myself without any thought of
      obtaining a position in Spain. However, the ties of friendship made me
      keep up my acquaintance with Varnier, the Duke of Medina Sidonia, and the
      architect, Sabatini, who always gave me a warm welcome, as did his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Ignazia had more of my company than ever, and congratulated me on my
      freedom from the cares of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the departure of Mocenigo I thought I would go and see if Querini,
      his nephew, was equally prejudiced against me. The porter told me that he
      had received orders not to admit me, and I laughed in the man&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six or seven weeks after Manucci&rsquo;s departure I, too, left Madrid. I did so
      on compulsion, in spite of my love for Ignazia, for I had no longer hopes
      of doing anything in Portugal, and my purse was nearly exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought of selling a handsome repeater and a gold snuff-box so as to
      enable me to go to Marseilles, whence I thought of going to Constantinople
      and trying my fortune there without turning renegade. Doubtless, I should
      have found the plan unsuccessful, for I was attaining an age when Fortune
      flies. I had no reason, however, to complain of Fortune, for she had been
      lavish in her gifts to me, and I in my turn had always abused them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my state of distress the learned Abbe Pinzi introduced me to a Genoese
      bookseller, named Carrado, a thoroughly honest man, who seemed to have
      been created that the knavery of most of the Genoese might be pardoned. To
      him I brought my watch and snuff-box, but the worthy Carrado not only
      refused to buy them, but would not take them in pledge. He gave me
      seventeen hundred francs with no other security than my word that I would
      repay him if I were ever able to do so. Unhappily I have never been able
      to repay this debt, unless my gratitude be accounted repayment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As nothing is sweeter than the companionship between a man and the woman
      he adores, so nothing is bitterer than the separation; the pleasure has
      vanished away, and only the pain remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent my last days at Madrid drinking the cup of pleasure which was
      embittered by the thought of the pain that was to follow. The worthy Diego
      was sad at the thought of losing me, and could with difficulty refrain
      from tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time my man Philippe continued to give me news of Donna Ignazia.
      She became the bride of a rich shoemaker, though her father was extremely
      mortified by her making a marriage so much beneath her station.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had promised the Marquis de las Moras and Colonel Royas that I would
      come and see them at Saragossa, the capital of Aragon, and I arrived there
      at the beginning of September. My stay lasted for a fortnight, during
      which time I was able to examine the manners and customs of the Aragonese,
      who were not subject to the ordinances of the Marquis of Aranda, as long
      cloaks and low hats were to be seen at every corner. They looked like dark
      phantoms more than men, for the cloak covered up at least half the face.
      Underneath the cloak was carried el Spadino, a sword of enormous length.
      Persons who wore this costume were treated with great respect, though they
      were mostly arrant rogues; still they might possibly be powerful noblemen
      in disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor to Saragossa should see the devotion which is paid to our Lady
      del Pilar. I have seen processions going along the streets in which wooden
      statues of gigantic proportions were carried. I was taken to the best
      assemblies, where the monks swarmed. I was introduced to a lady of
      monstrous size, who, I was informed, was cousin to the famous Palafox, and
      I did not feel my bosom swell with pride as was evidently expected. I also
      made the acquaintance of Canon Pignatelli, a man of Italian origin. He was
      President of the Inquisition, and every morning he imprisoned the
      procuress who had furnished him with the girl with whom he had supped and
      slept. He would wake up in the morning tired out with the pleasures of the
      night; the girl would be driven away and the procuress imprisoned. He then
      dressed, confessed, said mass, and after an excellent breakfast with
      plenty of good wine he would send out for another girl, and this would go
      on day after day. Nevertheless, he was held in great respect at Saragossa,
      for he was a monk, a canon, and an Inquisitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bull fights were finer at Saragossa than at Madrid&mdash;that is to
      say, they were deadlier; and the chief interest of this barbarous
      spectacle lies in the shedding of blood. The Marquis de las Moras and
      Colonel Royas gave me some excellent dinners. The marquis was one of the
      pleasantest men I met in Spain; he died very young two years after.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Church of Nuestra Senora del Pilar is situated on the ramparts of the
      town, and the Aragonese fondly believe this portion of the town defences
      to be impregnable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had promised Donna Pelliccia to go and see her at Valentia, and on my
      way I saw the ancient town of Saguntum on a hill at some little distance.
      There was a priest travelling with me and I told him and the driver (who
      preferred his mules to all the antiquities in the world) that I should
      like to go and see the town. How the muleteer and the priest objected to
      this proposal!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are only ruins there, senor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I want to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall never get to Valentia to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a crown; we shall get there to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crown settled everything, and the man exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Valga me Dios, es un hombre de buen!&rdquo; (So help me God, this is an honest
      man!) A subject of his Catholic majesty knows no heartier praise than
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw the massive walls still standing and in good condition, and yet they
      were built during the second Punic War. I saw on two of the gateways
      inscriptions which to me were meaningless, but which Seguier, the old
      friend of the Marquis Maffei, could no doubt have deciphered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of this monument to the courage of an ancient race, who
      preferred to perish in the flames rather than surrender, excited my awe
      and admiration. The priest laughed at me, and I am sure he would not have
      purchased this venerable city of the dead if he could have done so by
      saying a mass. The very name has perished; instead of Saguntum it is
      called Murviedro from the Latin &lsquo;muri veteres&rsquo; (old walls); but Time that
      destroys marble and brass destroys also the very memory of what has been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This place,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;is always called Murviedro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is ridiculous to do so,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;common sense forbids us calling a
      thing old which was once young enough. That&rsquo;s as if you would tell me that
      New Castille is really new.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Old Castille is more ancient than New Castille.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No so. New Castille was only called so because it was the latest
      conquest; but as a matter of fact it is the older of the two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor priest took refuge in silence; shaking his head, and evidently
      taking me for a madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried vainly to find Hannibal&rsquo;s head, and the inscription in honour of
      Caesar Claudius, but I found out the remains of the amphitheatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I remarked the mosaic pavement, which had been discovered
      twenty years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reached Valentia at nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and found that I should
      have to content myself with a bad lodging, as Marescalchi, the opera
      manager, had taken all the best rooms for the members of his company.
      Marescalchi was accompanied by his brother, a priest, whom I found
      decidedly learned for his age. We took a walk together, and he laughed
      when I proposed going into a cafe, for there was not such a thing in the
      town. There were only taverns of the lowest class where the wine is not
      fit to drink. I could scarcely believe it, but Spain is a peculiar
      country. When I was at Valentia, a good bottle of wine was scarcely
      obtainable, though Malaga and Alicante were both close at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first three days of my stay at Valentia (the birthplace of
      Alexander VI.), I saw all the objects of interest in the town, and was
      confirmed in my idea that what seems so admirable in the descriptions of
      writers and the pictures of artists loses much of its charm on actual
      inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Valentia is blessed with an excellent climate, though it is well
      watered, situated in the midst of a beautiful country, fertile in all the
      choicest products of nature, though it is the residence of many of the
      most distinguished of the Spanish nobility, though its women are the most
      handsome in Spain, though it has the advantage of being the seat of an
      archbishop; in spite of all these commodities, it is a most disagreeable
      town to live in. One is ill lodged and ill fed, there is no good wine and
      no good company, there is not even any intellectual provision, for though
      there is a university, lettered men are absolutely unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the bridges, churches, the arsenal, the exchange, the town hall,
      the twelve town gates, and the rest, I could not take pleasure in a town
      where the streets are not paved, and where a public promenade is
      conspicuous by its absence. Outside the town the country is delightful,
      especially on the side towards the sea; but the outside is not the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feature which pleased me most was the number of small one-horse
      vehicles which transport the traveller rapidly from one point to another,
      at a very slight expense, and will even undertake a two or three days&rsquo;
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      If my frame of mind had been a more pleasant one, I should have travelled
      through the kingdoms of Murcia and Grenada, which surpass Italy in beauty
      and fertility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Spaniards! This beauty and fertility of your land are the cause of
      your ignorance, as the mines of Peru and Potosi have brought about that
      foolish pride and all the prejudices which degrade you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spaniards, when will the impulse come? when will you shake off that fatal
      lethargy? Now you are truly useless to yourselves, and the rest of the
      world; what is it you need?
    </p>
    <p>
      A furious revolution, a terrible shock, a conquest of regeneration; your
      case is past gentle methods, it needs the cautery and the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first call I paid was on Donna Pelliccia. The first performance was to
      be given in two days. This was not a matter of any difficulty, as the same
      operas were to be presented as had been already played at Aranjuez, the
      Escurial, and the Granja, for the Count of Aranda would never have dared
      to sanction the performance of an Italian comic opera at Madrid. The
      novelty would have been too great, and the Inquisition would have
      interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The balls were a considerable shock, and two years after they were
      suppressed. Spain will never make any real advance, until the Inquisition
      is suppressed also.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Donna Pelliccia arrived, she sent in the letter of introduction
      she had received from the Duke of Arcos, three months before. She had not
      seen the duke since their meeting at Aranjuez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Don Diego, the person to whom she was commended, &ldquo;I have
      come to offer you my services, and to tell you of the orders his grace has
      laid on me, of which you may possibly be ignorant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, sir,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;that I am not putting you to any
      inconvenience, but I am extremely grateful to the duke and to yourself;
      and I shall have the honour of calling on you to give you my thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; I have only to say that I have orders to furnish you with any
      sums you may require, to the amount of twenty-five thousand doubloons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five thousand doubloons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, madam, two hundred and fifty thousand francs in French money,
      and no more. Kindly read his grace&rsquo;s letter; you do not seem to be aware
      of its contents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter was a brief one:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don Diego,&mdash;You will furnish Donna Pelliccia with whatever sums she
      may require, not exceeding twenty-five thousand doubloons, at my account.
      &ldquo;THE DUKE DOS ARCOS&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We remained in a state of perfect stupefaction. Donna Pelliccia returned
      the epistle to the banker, who bowed and took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sounds almost incredible generosity, but in Spain such things are not
      uncommon. I have already mentioned the munificent gift of Medina-Celi to
      Madame Pichona.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who are unacquainted with the peculiar Spanish character and the
      vast riches of some of the nobility, may pronounce such acts of generosity
      to be ridiculous and positively injurious, but they make a mistake. The
      spendthrift gives and squanders by a kind of instinct, and so he will
      continue to do as long as his means remain. But these splendid gifts I
      have described do not come under the category of senseless prodigality.
      The Spaniard is chiefly ambitious of praise, for praise he will do
      anything; but this very desire for admiration serves to restrain him from
      actions by which he would incur blame. He wants to be thought superior to
      his fellows, as the Spanish nation is superior to all other nations; he
      wants to be thought worthy of a throne, and to be considered as the
      possessor of all the virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may also note that while some of the Spanish nobility are as rich as the
      English lords, the former have not so many ways of spending their money as
      the latter, and thus are enabled to be heroically generous on occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Don Diego had gone, we began to discuss the duke&rsquo;s noble
      behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Pelliccia maintained that the duke had wished to shew his confidence
      in her by doing her the honour of supposing her incapable of abusing his
      generosity; &ldquo;at all events,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;I would rather die of hunger
      than take a single doubloon of Don Diego.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The duke would be offended,&rdquo; said a violinist; &ldquo;I think you ought to take
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take it all,&rdquo; said the husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was of the lady&rsquo;s opinion, and told her that I was sure the duke would
      reward her delicacy by making her fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed my advice and her own impulse, though the banker remonstrated
      with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the perversity of the human mind that no one believed in Donna
      Pelliccia&rsquo;s delicacy. When the king heard what had happened he ordered the
      worthy actress to leave Madrid, to prevent the duke ruining himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is often the reward of virtue here below, but the malicious persons
      who had tried to injure Donna Pelliccia by calumniating her to the king
      were the means of making her fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke who had only spoken once or twice to the actress in public, and
      had never spent a penny on her, took the king&rsquo;s command as an insult, and
      one not to be borne. He was too proud to solicit the king to revoke the
      order he had given, and in the end behaved in a way befitting so
      noble-minded a man. For the first time he visited Donna Pelliccia at her
      own house, and begging her to forgive him for having been the innocent
      cause of her disgrace, asked her to accept a rouleau and a letter which he
      laid on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rouleau contained a hundred gold ounces with the words &ldquo;for travelling
      expenses,&rdquo; and the letter was addressed to a Roman bank, and proved to be
      an order for twenty-four thousand Roman crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      For twenty-nine years this worthy woman kept an establishment at Rome, and
      did so in a manner which proved her worthy of her good fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after Donna Pelliccia&rsquo;s departure the king saw the Duke of Arcos,
      and told him not to be sad, but to forget the woman, who had been sent
      away for his own good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By sending her away, your majesty obliged me to turn fiction into fact,
      for I only knew her by speaking to her in various public places, and I had
      never made her the smallest present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you never gave her twenty-five thousand doubloons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I gave her double that sum, but only on the day before yesterday.
      Your majesty has absolute power, but if she had not received her dismissal
      I should never have gone to her house, nor should I have given her the
      smallest present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king was stupefied and silent; he was probably meditating on the
      amount of credit a monarch should give to the gossip that his courtiers
      bring him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard about this from M. Monnino, who was afterwards known under the
      title of Castille de Florida Blanca, and is now living in exile in Murcia,
      his native country.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Marescalchi had gone, and I was making my preparations for my
      journey to Barcelona, I saw one day, at the bull fight, a woman whose
      appearance had a strange kind of fascination about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a knight of Alcantara at my side, and I asked him who the lady
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is the famous Nina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How famous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do not know her story, it is too long to be told here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not help gazing at her, and two minutes later an ill-looking
      fellow beside her came up to my companion and whispered something in his
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knight turned towards me and informed me in the most polite manner
      that the lady whose name I had asked desired to know mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was silly enough to be flattered by her curiosity, and told the
      messenger that if the lady would allow me I would come to her box and tell
      her my name in person after the performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From your accent I should suppose you were an Italian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a Venetian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So is she.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone away my neighbour seemed inclined to be more
      communicative, and informed me that Nina was a dancer whom the Count de
      Ricla, the Viceroy of Barcelona, was keeping for some weeks at Valentia,
      till he could get her back to Barcelona, whence the bishop of the diocese
      had expelled her on account of the scandals to which she gave rise. &ldquo;The
      count,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;is madly in love with her, and allows her fifty
      doubloons a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope she does not spend them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t do that, but she does not let a day pass without committing
      some expensive act of folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt curious to know a woman of such a peculiar character, and longed
      for the end of the bull fight, little thinking in what trouble this new
      acquaintance would involve me.
    </p>
    <p>
      She received me with great politeness, and as she got into her carriage
      drawn by six mules, she said she would be delighted if I would breakfast
      with her at nine o&rsquo;clock on the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I promised to come, and I kept my word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her house was just outside the town walls, and was a very large building.
      It was richly and tastefully furnished, and was surrounded by an enormous
      garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing that struck me was the number of the lackeys and the
      richness of their liveries, and the maids in elegant attire, who seemed to
      be going and coming in all directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I advanced I heard an imperious voice scolding some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scold was Nina, who was abusing an astonished-looking man, who was
      standing by a large table covered with stuffs and laces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but this fool of a Spaniard wants to persuade me
      that this lace is really handsome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She asked me what I thought of the lace, and though I privately thought it
      lace of the finest quality, I did not care to contradict her, and so
      replied that I was no judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said the tradesman, &ldquo;if you do not like the lace, leave it; will
      you keep the stuffs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;and as for the lace, I will shew you that it is not
      the money that deters me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying the mad girl took up a pair of scissors and cut the lace into
      fragments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; said the man who had spoken to me at the bull fight.
      &ldquo;People will say that you have gone off your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent, you pimping rogue!&rdquo; said she, enforcing her words with a
      sturdy box on the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow went off, calling her strumpet, which only made her scream with
      laughter; then, turning to the Spaniard, she told him to make out his
      account directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man did not want telling twice, and avenged himself for the abuse he
      had received by the inordinate length of his bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took up the account and placed her initials at the bottom without
      deigning to look at the items, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to Don Diego Valencia; he will pay you immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as we were alone the chocolate was served, and she sent a message
      to the fellow whose ears she had boxed to come to breakfast directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be surprised at my way of treating him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a
      rascal whom Ricla has placed in my house to spy out my actions, and I
      treat him as you have seen, so that he may have plenty of news to write to
      his master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought I must be dreaming; such a woman seemed to me beyond the limits
      of the possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor wretch, who came from Bologna and was a musician by profession,
      came and sat down with us without a word. His name was Molinari.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had finished his breakfast he left the room, and Nina spent
      an hour with me talking about Spain, Italy, and Portugal, where she had
      married a dancer named Bergonzi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;was the famous charlatan Pelandi; you may have
      known him at Venice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this piece of confidence (and she did not seem at all ashamed of her
      parentage) she asked me to sup with her, supper being her favourite meal.
      I promised to come, and I left her to reflect on the extraordinary
      character of the woman, and on the good fortune which she so abused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nina was wonderfully beautiful; but as it has always been my opinion that
      mere beauty does not go for much, I could not understand how a viceroy
      could have fallen in love with her to such an extent. As for Molinari,
      after which I had seen, I could only set him down as an infamous wretch.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to supper with her for amusement&rsquo;s sake, for, with all her beauty,
      she had not touched my heart in the slightest degree. It was at the
      beginning of October, but at Valentia the thermometer marked twenty
      degrees Reaumur in the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nina was walking in the garden with her companion, both of them being very
      lightly clad; indeed, Nina had only her chemise and a light petticoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she saw me she came up and begged me to follow their example in
      the way of attire, but I begged to be excused. The presence of that
      hateful fellow revolted me in the highest degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the interval before supper Nina entertained me with a number of
      lascivious anecdotes of her experiences from the time she began her
      present mode of living up to the age of twenty-two, which was her age
      then.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it had not been for the presence of the disgusting Argus, no doubt all
      these stories would have produced their natural effect on me; but as it
      was they had none whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had a delicate supper and ate with appetite, and after it was over I
      would have gladly left them; but Nina would not let me go. The wine had
      taken effect, and she wished to have a little amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all the servants had been dismissed, this Messalina ordered Molinari
      to strip naked, and she then began to treat him in a manner which I cannot
      describe without disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rascal was young and strong, and, though he was drunk, Nina&rsquo;s
      treatment soon placed him in a hearty condition. I could see that she
      wished me to play my part in the revels, but my disgust had utterly
      deprived me of all my amorous faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nina, too, had undressed, and seeing that I viewed the orgy coldly she
      proceeded to satiate her desires by means of Molinari.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to bear with the sight of this beautiful woman coupling herself with
      an animal, whose only merit lay in his virile monstrosity, which she no
      doubt regarded as a beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had exhausted her amorous fury she threw herself into a bath,
      then came back, drank a bottle of Malmsey Madeira, and finally made her
      brutal lover drink till he fell on to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fled into the next room, not being able to bear it any longer, but she
      followed me. She was still naked, and seating herself beside me on an
      ottoman she asked me how I had enjoyed the spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her boldy that the disgust with which her wretched companion had
      inspired me was so great that it had utterly annulled the effect of her
      charms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be so, but now he is not here, and yet you do nothing. One would
      not think it, to look at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, for I have my feelings like any other man, but he has
      disgusted me too much. Wait till tomorrow, and let me not see that monster
      so unworthy of enjoying you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not enjoy me. If I thought he did I would rather die than let him
      have to do with me, for I detest him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you do not love him, and yet you make use of him in the way you
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, just as I might use a mechanical instrument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this woman I saw an instance of the depths of degradation to which
      human nature may be brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked me to sup with her on the following day, telling me that we
      would be alone, as Molinari would be ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will have got over the effects of the wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you he will be ill. Come to-morrow, and come every evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not go for a week, and then we will go together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you go you will insult me beyond bearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went home with my mind made up to depart without having anything more to
      do with her; and though I was far from inexperienced in wickedness of all
      kinds, I could not help feeling astonished at the unblushing frankness of
      this Megaera, who had told me what I already knew, but in words that I had
      never heard a woman use before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only use him to satisfy my desires, and because I am certain that he
      does not love me; if I thought he did I would rather die than allow him to
      do anything with me, for I detest him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day I went to her at seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening. She received
      me with an air of feigned melancholy, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! we shall have to sup alone; Molinari has got the colic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said he would be ill; have you poisoned him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite capable of doing so, but I hope I never shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have given him something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only what he likes himself; but we will talk of that again. Let us sup
      and play till to-morrow, and tomorrow evening we will begin again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going away at seven o&rsquo;clock to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, you are not; and your coachman will have no cause for complaint,
      for he has been paid; here is the receipt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These remarks, delivered with an air of amorous despotism, flattered my
      vanity. I made up my mind to submit gaily, called her wanton, and said I
      was not worth the pains she was taking over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What astonishes me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is that with this fine house you do not
      care to entertain company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody is afraid to come; they fear Ricla&rsquo;s jealousy, for it is well
      known that that animal who is now suffering from the colic tells him
      everything I do. He swears that it is not so, but I know him to be a liar.
      Indeed, I am very glad he does write to Ricla, and only wish he had
      something of real importance to write about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will tell him that I have supped alone with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the better; are you afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I think you ought to tell me if I have anything really to fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all; it will fall on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I should not like to involve you in a dispute which might be
      prejudicial to your interests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; the more I provoke him, the better he loves me, and I will
      make him pay dearly when he asks me to make it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t love him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to ruin him; but he is so rich that there doesn&rsquo;t seem much hope of
      my ever doing that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before me I saw a woman as beautiful as Venus and as degraded as Lucifer;
      a woman most surely born to be the ruin of anyone who had the misfortune
      to fall in love with her. I had known women of similar character, but
      never one so dangerous as she.
    </p>
    <p>
      I determined to make some money out of her if I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      She called for cards, and asked me to play with her at a game called
      primiera. It is a game of chance, but of so complicated a nature that the
      best player always wins. In a quarter of an hour I found that I was the
      better player, but she had such luck that at the end of the game I had
      lost twenty pistoles, which I paid on the spot. She took the money,
      promising to give me my revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had supper, and then we committed all the wantonness she wished and I
      was capable of performing, for with me the age of miracles was past.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I called to see her earlier in the evening. We played again;
      and she lost, and went on losing evening after evening, till I had won a
      matter of two or three hundred doubloons, no unwelcome addition to my
      somewhat depleted purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spy recovered from his colic and supped with us every evening, but his
      presence no longer interfered with my pleasure since Nina had ceased to
      prostitute herself to him in my presence. She did the opposite; giving
      herself to me, and telling him to write to the Comte de Ricla whatever he
      liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count wrote her a letter which she gave me to read. The poor love-sick
      viceroy informed her that she might safely return to Barcelona, as the
      bishop had received an order from the Court to regard her as merely an
      actress, whose stay in his diocese would only be temporary; she would thus
      be allowed to live there in peace so long as she abstained from giving
      cause for scandal. She told me that whilst she was at Barcelona I could
      only see her after ten o&rsquo;clock at night, when the count always left her.
      She assured me that I should run no risk whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possibly I should not have stayed at Barcelona at all if Nina had not told
      me that she would always be ready to lend me as much money as I wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked me to leave Valentia a day before her, and to await her at
      Tarragona. I did so, and spent a very pleasant day in that town, which
      abounds in remains of antiquity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ordered a choice supper according to her instructions, and took care
      that she should have a separate bedroom so as to avoid any scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started in the morning begging me to wait till the evening, and to
      travel by night so as to reach Barcelona by day-time. She told me to put
      up at the &ldquo;Santa Maria,&rdquo; and not to call till I had heard from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed all the directions given me by this curious woman, and found
      myself comfortably lodged at Barcelona. My landlord was a Swiss who told
      me in confidence that he had received instructions to treat me well, and
      that I had only to ask for what I wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall see soon what was the result of all this.

    <p>
      Although my Swiss landlord seemed an honest and trustworthy kind of man, I
      could not help thinking that Nina had acted very imprudently in commending
      me to him. She was the viceroy&rsquo;s mistress; and though the viceroy might be
      a very agreeable man, he was a Spaniard, and not likely to be easy-going
      in his love affairs. Nina herself had told me that he was ardent, jealous,
      and suspicious. But the mischief was done, and there was no help for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got up my landlord brought me a valet de place, for whose character
      he said he could answer, and he then sent up an excellent dinner. I had
      slept till three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner I summoned my host, and asked him whether Nina had told him
      to get me a servant. He answered in the affirmative, and added that a
      carriage was awaiting my commands at the door; it had been taken by the
      week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am astonished to hear it, for no one but myself can say what I can
      afford or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, everything is paid for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paid for! I will not have it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can settle that with her, but I shall certainly take no payment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw dangers ahead, but as I have never cared to cherish forbodings I
      dismissed the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a letter of introduction from the Marquis de las Moras to Don Miguel
      de Cevallos, and another from Colonel Royas to Don Diego de la Secada. I
      took my letters, and the next day Don Diego came to see me, and took me to
      the Comte de Peralada. The day after Don Miguel introduced me to the Comte
      de Ricla, Viceroy of Catalonia, and the lover of Nina.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Comte de Peralada was a young man with a pleasant face but with an
      ill-proportioned body. He was a great debauchee and lover of bad company,
      an enemy of religion, morality, and law. He was directly descended from
      the Comte de Peralada, who served Philip II. so well that this king
      declared him &ldquo;count by the grace of God.&rdquo; The original patent of nobility
      was the first thing I saw in his antechamber, where it was framed and
      glazed so that all visitors might see it in the quarter of an hour they
      were kept waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count received me with an easy and cordial manner, which seemed to
      say that he renounced all the dignities of his rank. He thanked Don Diego
      for introducing me, and talked a good deal about Colonel Royas. He asked
      me if I had seen the English girl he was keeping at Saragossa, and on my
      replying in the affirmative, he told me in a whisper that he had slept
      with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took me to his stables, where he had some splendid horses, and then
      asked me to dine with him the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The viceroy received me in a very different manner; he stood up so that he
      might not have to offer me a chair, and though I spoke Italian, with which
      language I knew him to be well acquainted, he answered me in Spanish,
      styling me &lsquo;ussia&rsquo; (a contraction of &lsquo;vuestra senoria&rsquo;, your lordship, and
      used by everyone in Spain), while I gave him his proper title of
      excellence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked a good deal about Madrid, and complained that M. de Mocenigo had
      gone to Paris by Bayonne instead of Barcelona, as he had promised him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to excuse my ambassador by saying that by taking the other route
      he had saved fifty leagues of his journey, but the viceroy replied that
      &lsquo;tenir la palabra&rsquo; (keeping to one&rsquo;s words) comes before all else.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked me if I thought of staying long at Barcelona, and seemed
      surprised when I told him that, with his leave, I hoped to make a long
      stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will enjoy yourself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I must warn you that if
      you indulge in the pleasures which my nephew Peralada will doubtless offer
      you, you will not enjoy a very good reputation at Barcelona.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the Comte de Ricla made this observation in public, I thought myself
      justified in communicating it to Peralada himself. He was delighted, and
      told me, with evident vanity, that he had gone to Madrid three times, and
      had been ordered to return to Catalonia on each occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought my best plan would be to follow the viceroy&rsquo;s indirect advice,
      so I refused to join in any of the little parties of pleasure which
      Peralada proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fifth day after my arrival, an officer came to ask me to dinner at
      the viceroy&rsquo;s. I accepted the invitation with much pleasure, for I had
      been afraid of the viceroy&rsquo;s having heard of my relations with Nina, and
      thought it possible that he might have taken a dislike to me. He was very
      pleasant to me at dinner, often addressing his observations to me, but
      always in a tone of great gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been in Barcelona for a week, and was beginning to wonder why I had
      not heard from Nina; but one evening she wrote me a note, begging me to
      come on foot and alone to her house at ten o&rsquo;clock the same night.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had been wise I should not have gone, for I was not in love with the
      woman, and should have remembered the respect due to the viceroy; but I
      was devoid of all wisdom and prudence. All the misfortunes I have
      experienced in my long life never taught me those two most necessary
      virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the hour she had named I called on her, wearing my great coat, and with
      a sword for my only weapon. I found Nina with her sister, a woman of
      thirty-six or thereabouts, who was married to an Italian dancer, nicknamed
      Schizza, because he had a flatter nose than any Tartar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nina had just been supping with her lover, who had left her at ten
      o&rsquo;clock, according to his invariable custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said she was delighted to hear I had been to dinner with him, as she
      had herself spoken to him in my praise, saying how admirably I had kept
      her company at Valentia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear it, but I do not think you are wise in inviting me to
      your house at such late hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only do so to avoid scandal amongst my neighbours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my opinion my coming so late is only likely to increase the
      probability of scandal, and to make your viceroy jealous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will never hear of your coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went away at midnight, after a conversation of the most decent
      character. Her sister did not leave us for a moment, and Nina gave her no
      cause to suspect the intimacy of our relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to see her every evening, without encroaching on the count&rsquo;s
      preserves. I thought myself secure, but the following warning should have
      made me desist if I had not been carried away by the forces of destiny and
      obstinacy in combination.
    </p>
    <p>
      An officer in the Walloon Guards accosted me one day as I was walking by
      myself just outside the town. He begged me in the most polite manner to
      excuse him if he spoke on a matter which was indifferent to him but of
      great consequence to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, sir,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I will take whatever you say in good part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. You are a stranger, sir, and may not be acquainted with our
      Spanish manners, consequently you are unaware of the great risk you run in
      going to see Nina every evening after the count has left her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What risk do I run? I have no doubt that the count knows all about it and
      does not object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt as to his knowing it, and he may possibly pretend to know
      nothing before her, as he fears as well as loves her; but if she tells you
      that he does not object, she either deceives herself or you. He cannot
      love her without being jealous, and a jealous Spaniard . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow my advice, sir, and forgive my freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sincerely obliged to you for your kind interest in me, but I cannot
      follow your advice, as by doing so I should be wanting in politeness to
      Nina, who likes to see me and gives me a warm welcome. I shall continue to
      visit her till she orders me not to do so, or till the count signifies to
      me his displeasure at my visits to his mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The count will never do such a thing; he is too careful of his dignity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The worthy officer then narrated to me all the acts of injustice which
      Ricla had committed since he had fallen in love with this woman. He had
      dismissed gentlemen from his service on the mere suspicion that they were
      in love with her; some had been exiled, and others imprisoned on one
      frivolous pretext or another. Before he had known Nina he had been a
      pattern of wisdom, justice, and virtue, and now he had become unjust,
      cruel, blindly passionate, and in every way a scandal to the high position
      he occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this should have influenced me, but it had not the slightest effect. I
      told him for politeness&rsquo; sake that I would endeavour to part from her by
      degrees, but I had no intention of doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I asked him how he knew that I visited Nina, he laughed and said it
      was a common topic of conversation all over the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same evening I called on her without mentioning my conversation with
      the officer. There would have been some excuse for me if I had been in
      love with her, but as it was . . . I acted like a madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 14th of November I went to see her at the usual time. I found her
      with a man who was shewing her miniatures. I looked at him and found that
      he was the scoundrel Passano, or Pogomas.
    </p>
    <p>
      My blood boiled; I took Nina&rsquo;s hand and led her into a neighbouring room,
      and told her to dismiss the rogue at once, or I would go to return no
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a painter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am well acquainted with his history, and will tell you all about it
      presently; but send him away, or I shall go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She called her sister, and told her to order the Genoese to leave the
      house and never to enter it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing was done in a moment, but the sister told us that as he went
      out he had said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Se ne pentira.&rdquo; (&ldquo;He shall be sorry for it.&rdquo;).
    </p>
    <p>
      I occupied an hour in relating some of the injuries I had received from
      this scoundrelly fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day (November 15th), I went to Nina at the usual time, and after
      spending two hours in pleasant converse with her and her sister I went out
      as the clocks were striking midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the house was under an arcade, which extended to the end of
      the street. It was a dark night; and I had scarcely gone twenty-five paces
      when two men suddenly rushed at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped back, drawing my sword, and exclaiming, &ldquo;Assassins!&rdquo; and then
      with a rapid movement, I thrust my blade into the body of the nearest
      assailant. I then left the arcade, and began to run down the street. The
      second assassin fired a pistol at me, but it fortunately missed me. I fell
      down and dropped my hat in my rapid flight, and got up and continued my
      course without troubling to pick it up. I did not know whether I was
      wounded or not, but at last I got to my inn, and laid down the bloody
      sword on the counter, under the landlord&rsquo;s nose. I was quite out of
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told the landlord what had happened, and on taking off my great coat, I
      found it to be pierced in two places just below the armpit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to bed,&rdquo; I said to the landlord, &ldquo;and I leave my great coat
      and the sword in your charge. Tomorrow morning I shall ask you to come
      with me before the magistrate to denounce this act of assassination, for
      if the man was killed it must be shewn that I only slew him to save my own
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think your best plan would be to fly Barcelona immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think I have not told you the strict truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you have; but I know whence the blow comes, and God knows what
      will befall you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all; but if I fly I shall be accounted guilty. Take care of
      the sword; they tried to assassinate me, but I think the assassins got the
      worst of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went to bed somewhat perturbed, but I had the consoling thought that if
      I had killed a man I had done so to self-defence; my conscience was quite
      clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o&rsquo;clock the next morning I heard a knocking at my door. I opened
      it, and saw my landlord, accompanied by an officer, who told me to give
      him all my papers, to dress, and to follow him, adding that he should be
      compelled to use force in case of resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no intention of resisting,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;By whose authority do you
      ask me for my papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the authority of the governor. They will be returned to you if nothing
      suspicious is found amongst them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going to take me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the citadel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I opened my trunk, took out my linen and my clothes, which I gave to my
      landlord, and I saw the officer&rsquo;s astonishment at seeing my trunk half
      filled with papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are all the papers I have,&rdquo; I said. I locked the box and gave the
      officer the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I advise you, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to put all necessary articles into a
      portmanteau.&rdquo; He then ordered the landlord to send me a bed, and finally
      asked me if I had any papers in my pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only my passports.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what we want,&rdquo; he rejoined, with a grim smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My passports are sacred; I will never give them to anyone but the
      governor-general. Reverence your king; here is his passport, here is that
      of the Count of Aranda, and here the passport of the Venetian ambassador.
      You will have to bind me hand and foot before you get them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be more moderate, sir. In giving them to me it is just as if you gave
      them to the viceroy. If you resist I will not bind you hand and foot, but
      I shall take you before the viceroy, and then you will be forced to give
      them up in public. Give them to me with a good grace, and you shall have
      an acknowledgement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The worthy landlord told me I should be wiser to give in, so I let myself
      be persuaded. The officer gave me a full quittance, which I put in my
      pocketbook (this he let me keep out of his kindness), and then I followed
      him. He had six constables with him, but they kept a good distance away.
      Comparing this with the circumstances of my arrest at Madrid, I thought
      myself well treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we left the inn the officer told me that I might order what meals I
      pleased, and I asked the landlord to let me have my dinner and supper as
      usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way I told him of my adventure of the night before; he listened
      attentively but made no comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we reached the citadel I was delivered to the officer of the guard,
      who gave me a room on the first floor. It was bare of furniture, but the
      windows looked on to a square and had no iron bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had scarcely been there ten minutes when my carpet bag and an excellent
      bed were brought in.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I was alone I began to think over the situation. I finished
      where I ought to have begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can this imprisonment have to do with my last night&rsquo;s adventure?&rdquo; I
      reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not make out the connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are bent on examining my papers; they must think I have been
      tampering in some political or religious intrigue; but my mind is quite at
      ease on that score. I am well lodged at present, and no doubt shall be set
      free after my papers have been examined; they can find nothing against me
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The affair of my attempted assassination will, no doubt, be considered
      separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if the rascal is dead, I do not see what they can do to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the other hand, my landlord&rsquo;s advice to fly from Barcelona looks
      ominous; what if the assassins received their orders from some person high
      in authority?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible that Ricla may have vowed my ruin, but it does not seem
      probable to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it have been wise to follow the landlord&rsquo;s advice?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly, but I do not think so; my honour would have suffered, and I
      might have been caught and laid up in some horrid dungeon, whereas for a
      prison I am comfortable enough here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In three or four days the examination of my papers will have been
      completed, and as there is nothing in them likely to be offensive to the
      powers that be, they will be returned to me with my liberty, which will
      taste all the sweeter for this short deprivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for my passports they all speak in my favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot think that the all-powerful hand of the viceroy could have
      directed the assassin&rsquo;s sword; it would be a dishonour to him, and if it
      were so, he would not be treating me so kindly now. If it were his doing,
      he must have heard directly that the blow had failed, and in that case I
      do not think he would have arrested me this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I write to Nina? Will writing be allowed here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I was puzzling my brains with these reflections, stretched on my bed
      (for I had no chair), I heard some disturbance, and on opening my window I
      saw, to my great astonishment, Passano being brought into the prison by a
      corporal and two soldiers. As he was going in, the rascal looked up and
      saw me, and began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;here is fresh food for conjecture. The fellow
      told Nina&rsquo;s sister that I should be sorry for what I had done. He must
      have directed some fearful calumny against me, and they are imprisoning
      him so as to be sure of his evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On reflection, I was well pleased at the turn affairs had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      An excellent dinner was set before me, but I had no chair or table. The
      deficiency was remedied by the soldier who was in charge of me for the
      consideration of a duro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prisoners were not allowed to have pen and ink without special permission;
      but paper and pencils were not included under this regulation, so my guard
      got them for me, together with candles and candlesticks, and I proceeded
      to kill time by making geometrical calculations. I made the obliging
      soldier sup with me, and he promised to commend me to one of his comrades
      who would serve me well. The guard was relieved at eleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fourth day the officer of the guard came to me with a distressed
      look, and told me that he had the disagreeable duty of giving me some very
      bad news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have received orders to transfer you to the bottom of the tower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To transfer me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they must have discovered in me a criminal of the deepest dye! Let
      us go at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I found myself in a kind of round cellar, paved with large flagstones, and
      lighted by five or six narrow slits in the walls. The officer told me I
      must order what food required to be brought once a day, as no one was
      allowed to come into the &lsquo;calabozo&rsquo;, or dungeon, by night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about lights?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may lave one lamp always burning, and that will be enough, as books
      are not allowed. When your dinner is brought, the officer on duty will
      open the pies and the poultry to see that they do not contain any
      documents; for here no letters are allowed to come in or go out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have these orders been given for my especial benefit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; it is the ordinary rule. You will be able to converse with the
      sentinel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The door will be open, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the cleanliness of my cell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A soldier will accompany the officer in charge of your dinner, and he
      will attend to your wants for a trifle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I amuse myself by making architectural plans with the pencil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much as you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then will you be good enough to order some paper to be bought for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer seemed to pity me as he left me, and bolted and barred the
      heavy door behind which I saw a man standing sentry with his bayonet
      fixed. The door was fitted with a small iron grating.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got my paper and my dinner at noonday the officer cut open a fowl,
      and plunged a fork in the other dishes so as to make sure that there were
      no papers at the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dinner would have sufficed for six people. I told the officer that I
      should be much honoured by his dining with me, but he replied that it was
      strictly forbidden. He gave me the same answer when I asked if I might
      have the newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a festival time for the sentinels, as I shared my meals and my good
      wine with them; and consequently these poor fellows were firmly attached
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was curious to know who was paying for my good cheer, but there was no
      chance of my finding out, for the waiter from the inn was never allowed to
      approach my cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this dungeon, where I was imprisoned for forty-two days, I wrote in
      pencil and without other reference than my memory, my refutation of Amelot
      de la Houssaye&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of the Venetian Government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was most heartily amused during my imprisonment, and in the following
      manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was at Warsaw an Italian named Tadini came to Warsaw. He had an
      introduction to Tomatis who commended him to me. He called himself an
      oculist. Tomatis used to give him a dinner now and again, but not being
      well off in those days I could only give him good words and a cup of
      coffee when he chanced to come about my breakfast-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tadini talked to everybody about the operations he had performed, and
      condemned an oculist who had been at Warsaw for twenty years, saying that
      he did not understand how to extract a cataract, while the other oculist
      said that Tadini was a charlatan who did not know how the eye was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tadini begged me to speak in his favour to a lady who had had a cataract
      removed by the Warsaw oculist, only to return again a short time after the
      operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady was blind of the one eye, but she could see with the other, and I
      told Tadini that I did not care to meddle with such a delicate matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have spoken to the lady,&rdquo; said Tadini, &ldquo;and I have mentioned your name
      as a person who will answer for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done wrong; in such a matter I would not stand surety for the
      most learned of men, and I know nothing about your learning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know I am an oculist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you were introduced to me as such, but that&rsquo;s all. As a
      professional man, you should not need anyone&rsquo;s commendation, you should be
      able to say, &lsquo;Operibus credite&rsquo;. That should be your motto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tadini was vexed with my incredulity, and shewed me a number of
      testimonials, which I might possibly have read, if the first which met my
      eye had not been from a lady who protested to all and singular that M.
      Tadini had cured her of amaurosis. At this I laughed in his face and told
      him to leave me alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after I found myself dining with him at the house of the lady
      with the cataract. She had almost made up her mind to submit to the
      operation, but as the rascal had mentioned my name, she wanted me to be
      present at a dispute between Tadini and the other oculist who came in with
      the dessert.
    </p>
    <p>
      I disposed myself to listen to the arguments of the two rival professors
      with considerable pleasure. The Warsaw oculist was a German, but spoke
      French very well; however, he attacked Tadini in Latin. The Italian
      checked him by saying that their discourse must be conducted in a language
      intelligible to the lady, and I agreed with him. It was plain that Tadini
      did not know a word of Latin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The German oculist began by admitting that after the operation for
      cataract there was no chance of the disease returning, but that there was
      a considerable risk of the crystalline humour evaporating, and the patient
      being left in a state of total blindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tadini, instead of denying this statement (which was inaccurate), had the
      folly to take a little box out of his pocket. It contained a number of
      minute round crystals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said the old professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A substance which I can place in the cornea to supply the loss of the
      crystalline matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The German went off into a roar of laughter so long and loud that the lady
      could not help laughing. I should have liked to join them, but I was
      ashamed to be thought the patron of this ignorant fellow, so I preserved a
      gloomy silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tadini no doubt interpreted my silence as a mark of disapproval of the
      German&rsquo;s laughter, and thought to better matters by asking me to give my
      opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you want to hear it,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;here it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a great difference between a tooth and the crystalline humour;
      and though you may have succeeded in putting an artificial tooth into a
      gum, this treatment will not do with the eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I am not a dentist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor an oculist either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this the ignorant rascal got up and left the room, and it was decidedly
      the best thing he could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      We laughed over this new treatment, and the lady promised to have nothing
      more to do with him. The professor was not content to despise his opponent
      in silence. He had him cited before the Faculty of Medicine to be examined
      on his knowledge of the eye, and procured the insertion of a satiric
      article in the news on the new operation for replacing the crystalline
      humour, alluding to the wonderful artist then in Warsaw who could perform
      this operation as easily as a dentist could put in a false tooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      This made Tadini furious, and he set upon the old professor in the street
      and forced him to the refuge in a house.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this he no doubt left the town on foot, for he was seen no more. Now
      the reader is in a position to understand my surprise and amusement, when,
      one day as I peered through the grating in my dungeon, I saw the oculist
      Tadini standing over me with gun in hand. But he at all events evinced no
      amusement whatever, while I roared and roared again with laughter for the
      two hours his duty lasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave him a good meal and a sufficiency of my excellent wine, and at the
      end a crown, promising that he should have the same treatment every time
      he returned to the post. But I only saw him four times, as the guard at my
      cell was a position eagerly coveted and intrigued for by the other
      soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He amused me by the story of his misadventures since he had left Warsaw.
      He had travelled far and wide without making a fortune, and at last
      arrived in Barcelona, where he failed to meet with any courtesy or
      consideration. He had no introduction, no diploma; he had refused to
      submit to an examination in the Latin tongue, because (as he said) there
      was no connection between the learned languages and the diseases of the
      eye; and the result was that, instead of the common fate of being ordered
      to leave the country, he was made into a soldier. He told me in confidence
      that he intended to desert, but he said he should take care to avoid the
      galleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done with your crystals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have renounced them since I left Warsaw, though I am sure they would
      succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I never heard of him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      On December 28th, six weeks after my arrest, the officer of the guard came
      to my cell and told me to dress and follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am about to deliver you to an officer of the viceroy, who is waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I dressed hastily, and after placing all my belongings in a portmanteau I
      followed him. We went to the guardroom, and there I was placed under the
      charge of the officer who had arrested me, who took me to the palace.
      There a Government official shewed me my trunk, telling me that I should
      find all my papers intact; and he then returned me my three passports,
      with the remark that they were genuine documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that all along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so, but we had reasons for doubting their authenticity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must have been strange reasons, for, as you now confess, these
      reasons were devoid of reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be aware that I cannot reply to such an objection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask you to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your character is perfectly clear; all the same I must request you to
      leave Barcelona in three days, and Catalonia in a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will obey; but it strikes me that the Catalonian method of
      repairing injustice is somewhat peculiar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you think you have ground for complaint you are at liberty to go to
      Madrid and complain to the Court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have certainly grounds enough for complaint, sir, but I shall go to
      France, and not to Madrid; I have had enough of Spanish justice. Will you
      please give me the order to leave in writing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s unnecessary; you may take it for granted. My name is Emmanuel
      Badillo; I am a secretary of state. That gentleman will escort you back to
      the room where you were arrested. You will find everything just as you
      have left it. You are a free man. To-morrow I will send you your passport,
      signed by the viceroy and myself. Good day, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accompanied by the officer and a servant bearing my portmanteau, I
      proceeded to my old inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my way I saw a theatrical poster, and decided to go to the opera. The
      good landlord was delighted to see me again, and hastened to light me a
      fire, for a bitterly cold north wind was blowing. He assured me that no
      one but himself had been in my room, and in the officer&rsquo;s presence he gave
      me back my sword, my great coat, and, to my astonishment, the hat I had
      dropped in my flight from the assassins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer asked me if I had any complaints to make, and I replied that I
      had none.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to hear you say that I had done nothing but my duty, and
      that personally I have not done you any injury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook his hand, and assured him of my esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I hope you will have a pleasant journey.&rdquo; I
      told my landlord that I would dine at noon, and that I trusted to him to
      celebrate my liberation in a fitting manner, and then I went to the post
      office to see if there were any letters for me. I found five or six
      letters, with the seals intact, much to my astonishment. What is one to
      make of a Government which deprives a man of his liberty on some trifling
      pretext, and, though seizing all his papers, respects the privacy of his
      letters? But Spain, as I have remarked, is peculiar in every way. These
      letters were from Paris, Venice, Warsaw, and Madrid, and I have never had
      any reason to believe that any other letters had come for me during my
      imprisonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went back to my inn, and asked my landlord to bring the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not owe me anything, sir. Here is your bill for the period
      preceding your imprisonment, and, as you see, it has been settled. I also
      received orders from the same source to provide for you during your
      imprisonment, and as long as you stayed at Barcelona.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know how long I should remain in prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I was paid by the week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who paid you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had any note for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has become of the valet de place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I paid him, and sent him away immediately after your arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to have him with me as far as Perpignan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, and I think the best thing you can do is to leave Spain
      altogether, for you will find no justice in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they say about my assassination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, they say you fired the shot that people heard yourself, and that you
      made your own sword bloody, for no one was found there, either dead or
      wounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an amusing theory. Where did my hat come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was brought to me three days after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a confusion! But was it known that I was imprisoned in the tower?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody knew it, and two good reasons were given, the one in public,
      and the other in private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are these reasons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The public reason was that you had forged your passports; the private
      one, which was only whispered at the ear, was that you spent all your
      nights with Nina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have sworn that I never slept out of your inn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told everyone as much, but no matter; you did go to her house, and for
      a certain nobleman that&rsquo;s a crime. I am glad you did not fly as I advised
      you, for as it is your character is cleared before everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to go to the opera this evening; take me a box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be done; but do not have anything more to do with Nina, I
      entreat you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my good friend, I have made up my mind to see her no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just as I was sitting down to dinner, a banker&rsquo;s clerk brought me a letter
      which pleased me very much. It contained the bills of exchange I had drawn
      in Genoa, in favour of M. Augustin Grimaldi. He now sent them back, with
      these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passano has been vainly endeavouring to persuade me to send these bills
      to Barcelona, so that they may be protested, and you arrested. I now send
      them to you to convince you that I am not one of those who delight in
      trampling down the victims of bad fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;Genoa, November 30th, 1768.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the fourth time a Genoese had behaved most generously to me. I was
      almost persuaded that I ought to forgive the infamous Passano for the sake
      of his four excellent fellow-countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this virtue was a little beyond me. I concluded that the best thing I
      could do would be to rid the Genoese name of the opprobrium which this
      rascal was always bringing on it, but I could never find an opportunity.
      Some years after I heard that the wretch died in miserable poverty in
      Genoa.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was curious at the time to know what had become of him, as it was
      important for me to be on my guard. I confided my curiosity to my
      landlord, and he instructed one of the servants to make enquiries. I only
      heard the following circumstance:
    </p>
    <p>
      Ascanio Pogomas, or Passano, had been released at the end of November, and
      had then been embarked on a felucca bound for Toulon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same day I wrote a long and grateful letter to M. Grimaldi. I had
      indeed reason to be grateful, for if he had listened to my enemy he might
      have reduced me to a state of dreadful misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      My landlord had taken the box at the opera in my name, and two hours
      afterwards, to everyone&rsquo;s great astonishment, the posters announcing the
      plays of the evening were covered by bills informing the public that two
      of the performers had been taken ill, that the play would not be given,
      and the theatre closed till the second day of the new year.
    </p>
    <p>
      This order undoubtedly came from the viceroy, and everybody knew the
      reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sorry to have deprived the people of Barcelona of the only amusement
      they had in the evening, and resolved to stay indoors, thinking that would
      be the most dignified course I could adopt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Petrarch says,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Amor che fa gentile un cor villano&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had known the lover of Nina he would have changed the line into
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Amor che fa villan un cor gentile&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      In four months I shall be able to throw some more light on this strange
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should have left Barcelona the same day, but a slight tinge of
      superstition made me desire to leave on the last day of the unhappy year I
      had spent in Spain. I therefore spent my three days of grace in writing
      letters to all my friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Miguel de Cevallos, Don Diego de la Secada, and the Comte de la
      Peralada came to see me, but separately. Don Diego de la Secada was the
      uncle of the Countess A&mdash;&mdash; B&mdash;&mdash; whom I had met at
      Milan. These gentlemen told me a tale as strange as any of the
      circumstances which had happened to me at Barcelona.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 26th of December the Abbe Marquisio, the envoy of the Duke of
      Modena, asked the viceroy, before a considerable number of people, if he
      could pay me a visit, to give me a letter which he could place in no hands
      but mine. If not he said he should be obliged to take the letter to
      Madrid, for which town he was obliged to set out the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count made no answer, to everyone&rsquo;s astonishment, and the abbe left
      for Madrid the next day, the eve of my being set at liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote to the abbe, who was unknown to me, but I never succeeded in
      finding out the truth about this letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      There could be no doubt that I had been arrested by the despotic viceroy,
      who had been persuaded by Nina that I was her favoured lover. The question
      of my passports must have been a mere pretext, for eight or ten days would
      have sufficed to send them to Madrid and have them back again if their
      authenticity had been doubted. Possibly Passano might have told the
      viceroy that any passports of mine were bound to be false, as I should
      have had to obtain the signature of my own ambassador. This, he might have
      said, was out of the question as I was in disgrace with the Venetian
      Government. As a matter of fact, he was mistaken if he really said so, but
      the mistake would have been an excusable one.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I made up my mind at the end of August to leave Madrid, I asked the
      Count of Aranda for a passport. He replied that I must first obtain one
      from my ambassador, who, he added, could not refuse to do me this service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortified with this opinion I called at the embassy. M. Querini was at San
      Ildefonso at the time, and I told the porter that I wanted to speak to the
      secretary of embassy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant sent in my name, and the fop gave himself airs, and pretended
      that he could not receive me. In my indignation I wrote to him saying that
      I had not called to pay my court to the secretary, but to demand a
      passport which was my right. I gave my name and my degree (doctor of law),
      and begged him to leave the passport with the porter, as I should call for
      it on the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I presented myself accordingly, and the porter told me that the ambassador
      had left verbal orders that I was not to have a passport.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote immediately to the Marquis Grimaldi and to the Duke of Lossada,
      begging them to request the ambassador to send me a passport in the usual
      form, or else I should publish the shameful reasons for which his uncle
      Mocenigo had disgraced me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know whether these gentlemen shewed my letters to Querini, but I
      do know that the secretary Oliviera sent me my passport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the Count Aranda furnished me with a passport signed by the
      king.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the last day of the year I left Barcelona with a servant who sat behind
      my chaise, and I agreed with my driver to take me to Perpignan by January
      3rd, 1769.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver was a Piedmontese and a worthy man. The next day he came into
      the room of the wayside inn where I was dining, and in the presence of my
      man asked me whether I had any suspicion that I was being followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I may be,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but what makes you ask that question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you were leaving Barcelona yesterday, I noticed three ill-looking
      fellows watching us, armed to the teeth. Last night they slept in the
      stable with my mules. They dined here to-day, and they went on three
      quarters of an hour ago. They don&rsquo;t speak to anyone, and I don&rsquo;t like the
      looks of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do to avoid assassination, or the dread of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must start late, and stop at an inn I know of, a league this side of
      the ordinary stage where they will be awaiting us. If they turn back, and
      sleep at the same inn as ourselves, we shall be certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought the idea a sensible one, and we started, I going on foot nearly
      the whole way; and at five o&rsquo;clock we halted at a wretched inn, but we saw
      no signs of the sinister trio.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o&rsquo;clock I was at supper, when my man came in and told me that the
      three fellows had come back, and were drinking with our driver in the
      stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hair stood on end. There could be no more doubt about the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      At present, it was true, I had nothing to fear; but it would be getting
      dark when we arrived at the frontier, and then my peril would come.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told my servant to shew no sign, but to ask the driver to come and speak
      with me when the assassins were asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came at ten o&rsquo;clock, and told me plainly that we should be all murdered
      as we approached the French frontier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have been drinking with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and after we had dispatched a bottle at my expense, one of them
      asked me why I had not gone on to the end of the stage, where you would be
      better lodged. I replied that it was late, and you were cold. I might have
      asked in my turn, why they had not stayed at the stage themselves, and
      where they were going, but I took care to do nothing of the kind. All I
      asked was whether the road to Perpignan was a good one, and they told me
      it was excellent all the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they doing now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are sleeping by my mules, covered with their cloaks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will start at day-break after them, of course, and we shall dine at
      the usual stage; but after dinner, trust me, we will take a different
      road, and at midnight we shall be in France safe and sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If I could have procured a good armed escort I would not have taken his
      advice, but in the situation I was in I had no choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found the three scoundrels in the place where the driver had told me we
      should see them. I gave them a searching glance, and thought they looked
      like true Sicarii, ready to kill anyone for a little money.
    </p>
    <p>
      They started in a quarter of an hour, and half an hour later we set out,
      with a peasant to guide us, and so struck into a cross road. The mules
      went at a sharp pace, and in seven hours we had done eleven leagues. At
      ten o&rsquo;clock we stopped at an inn in a French village, and we had no more
      to fear. I gave our guide a doubloon, with which he was well pleased, and
      I enjoyed once more a peaceful night in a French bed, for nowhere will you
      find such soft beds or such delicious wines as in the good land of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I arrived at the posting-inn at Perpignan in time for dinner.
      I endeavoured in vain to think who could have paid my assassins, but the
      reader will see the explanation when we get twenty days farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Perpignan I dismissed my driver and my servant, rewarding them
      according to my ability. I wrote to my brother at Paris, telling him I had
      had a fortunate escape from the dagger of the assassin. I begged him to
      direct his answer to Aix, where I intended to spend a fortnight, in the
      hope of seeing the Marquis d&rsquo;Argens. I left Perpignan the day after my
      arrival, and slept at Narbonne, and the day after at Beziers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distance from Narbonne to Beziers is only five leagues, and I had not
      intended to stop; but the good cheer which the kindest of landladies gave
      me at dinner made me stop with her to supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beziers is a town which looks pleasant even at the worst time of the year.
      A philosopher who wished to renounce all the vanities of the world, and an
      Epicurean who would enjoy good cheer cheaply, could find no better retreat
      than Beziers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody at Beziers is intelligent, all the women are pretty, and the
      cooks are all artists; the wines are exquisite&mdash;what more could one
      desire! May its riches never prove its ruin!
    </p>
    <p>
      When I reached Montpellier, I got down at the &ldquo;White Horse,&rdquo; with the
      intention of spending a week there. In the evening I supped at the table
      d&rsquo;hote, where I found a numerous company, and I saw to my amusement that
      for every guest there was a separate dish brought to table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowhere is there better fare than at Montpellier. &lsquo;Tis a veritable land of
      Cocagne!
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I breakfasted at the cafe (an institution peculiar to France,
      the only country where the science of living is really understood), and
      addressed the first gentleman I met, telling him that I was a stranger and
      that I would like to know some of the professors. He immediately offered
      to take me to one of the professors who enjoyed a great reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herein may be seen another of the good qualities of the French, who rank
      above other nations by so many titles. To a Frenchman a foreigner is a
      sacred being; he receives the best of hospitality, not merely in form, but
      in deed; and his welcome is given with that easy grace which so soon sets
      a stranger at his ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      My new friend introduced me to the professor, who received me with all the
      polished courtesy of the French man of letters. He that loves letters
      should love all other lovers of letters, and in France that is the case,
      even more so than Italy. In Germany the literary man has an air of
      mysterious reserve. He thinks he is proclaiming to all the world that he
      at all events is a man of no pretension, whereas his pride peeps through
      every moment. Naturally the stranger is not encouraged by such a manner as
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of my visit there was an excellent company of actors at
      Montpellier, whom I went to see the same evening. My bosom swelled at
      finding myself in the blessed air of France after all the annoyances I had
      gone through in Spain. I seemed to have become young again; but I was
      altered, for several beautiful and clever actresses appeared on the stage
      without arousing any desires within me; and I would have it so.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a lively desire to find Madame Castelbajac, not with any wish to
      renew my old relations with her. I wished to congratulate her on her
      improved position, but I was afraid of compromising her by asking for her
      in the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew that her husband was an apothecary, so I resolved to make the
      acquaintance of all the apothecaries in the place. I pretended to be in
      want of some very rare drugs, and entered into conversation about the
      differences between the trade in France and in foreign countries. If I
      spoke to the master I hoped he would talk to his wife about the stranger
      who had visited the countries where she had been, and that that would make
      her curious to know me. If, on the other hand, I spoke to the man, I knew
      he would soon tell me all he knew about his master&rsquo;s family.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third day my stratagem succeeded. My old friend wrote me a note,
      telling me that she had seen me speaking to her husband in his shop. She
      begged me to come again at a certain time, and to tell her husband that I
      had known her under the name of Mdlle. Blasin in England, Spa, Leipzig,
      and Vienna, as a seller of lace. She ended her note with these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt that my husband will finally introduce you to me as his
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I followed her advice, and the good man asked me if I had ever known a
      young lace seller of the name of Mdlle. Blasin, of Montpellier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember her well enough&mdash;a delightful and most respectable
      young woman; but I did not know she came from Montpellier. She was very
      pretty and very sensible, and I expect she did a good business. I have
      seen her in several European cities, and the last time at Vienna, where I
      was able to be of some slight service to her. Her admirable behaviour won
      her the esteem of all the ladies with whom she came in contact. In England
      I met her at the house of a duchess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you would recognize her if you saw her again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! I should think so! But is she at Montpellier? If so, tell her
      that the Chevalier de Seingalt is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you shall speak to her yourself, if you will do me the honour to
      follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My heart leapt, but I restrained myself. The worthy apothecary went
      through the shop, climbed a stair, and, opening a door on the first floor,
      said to me,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, mademoiselle! You here? I am delighted to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not a young lady, sir, &lsquo;tis my dear wife; but I hope that will
      not hinder you from embracing her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never had such an honour; but I will avail myself of your
      permission with pleasure. Then you have got married at Montpellier. I
      congratulate both of you, and wish you all health and happiness. Tell me,
      did you have a pleasant journey from Vienna to Lyons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Blasin (for so I must continue to designate her) answered my
      question according to her fancy, and found me as good an actor as she was
      an actress.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were very glad to see each other again, but the apothecary was
      delighted at the great respect with which I treated his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a whole hour we carried on a conversation of a perfectly imaginary
      character, and with all the simplicity of perfect truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked me if I thought of spending the carnival at Montpellier, and
      seemed quite mortified when I said that I thought of going on the next
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband hastened to say that that was quite out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope you won&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;you must do my husband the honour
      of dining with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the husband had pressed me for some time I gave in, and accepted
      their invitation to dinner for the day after next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of stopping two days I stopped four. I was much pleased with the
      husband&rsquo;s mother, who was advanced in years but extremely intelligent. She
      had evidently made a point of forgetting everything unpleasant in the past
      history of her son&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Blasin told me in private that she was perfectly happy, and I had
      every reason to believe that she was speaking the truth. She had made a
      rule to be most precise in fulfilling her wifely duties, and rarely went
      out unless accompanied by her husband or her mother-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent these four days in the enjoyment of pure and innocent friendship
      without there being the slightest desire on either side to renew our
      guilty pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third day after I had dined with her and her husband, she told me,
      while we were alone for a moment, that if I wanted fifty louis she knew
      where to get them for me. I told her to keep them for another time, if I
      was so happy as to see her again, and so unhappy as to be in want.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left Montpellier feeling certain that my visit had increased the esteem
      in which her husband and her mother-in-law held her, and I congratulated
      myself on my ability to be happy without committing any sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after I had bade them farewell, I slept at Nimes, where I spent
      three days in the company of a naturalist: M. de Seguier, the friend of
      the Marquis Maffei of Verona. In his cabinet of natural history I saw and
      admired the immensity and infinity of the Creator&rsquo;s handiwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nimes is a town well worthy of the stranger&rsquo;s observation; it provides
      food for the mind, and the fair sex, which is really fair there, should
      give the heart the food it likes best.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was asked to a ball, where, as a foreigner, I took first place&mdash;a
      privilege peculiar to France, for in England, and still more in Spain, a
      foreigner means an enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      On leaving Nimes I resolved to spend the carnival at Aix, where the
      nobility is of the most distinguished character. I believe I lodged at the
      &ldquo;Three Dolphins,&rdquo; where I found a Spanish cardinal on his way to Rome to
      elect a successor to Pope Rezzonico.

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     My Stay at Aix; I Fall Ill&mdash;I am Cared for By an Unknown
     Lady&mdash;The Marquis d&rsquo;Argens&mdash;Cagliostro
</pre>
    <p>
      My room was only separated from his Castilian eminence&rsquo;s by a light
      partition, and I could hear him quite plainly reprimanding his chief
      servant for being too economical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, I do my best, but it is really impossible to spend more, unless
      I compel the inn-keepers to take double the amount of their bills; and
      your eminence will admit that nothing in the way of rich and expensive
      dishes has been spared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be, but you ought to use your wits a little; you might for
      example order meals when we shall not require any. Take care that there
      are always three tables&mdash;one for us, one for my officers, and the
      third for the servants. Why I see that you only give the postillions a
      franc over the legal charge, I really blush for you; you must give them a
      crown extra at least. When they give you change for a louis, leave it on
      the table; to put back one&rsquo;s change in one&rsquo;s pocket is an action only
      worthy of a beggar. They will be saying at Versailles and Madrid, and
      maybe at Rome itself, that the Cardinal de la Cerda is a miser. I am no
      such thing, and I do not want to be thought one. You must really cease to
      dishonour me, or leave my service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A year before this speech would have astonished me beyond measure, but now
      I was not surprised, for I had acquired some knowledge of Spanish manners.
      I might admire the Senor de la Cerda&rsquo;s prodigality, but I could not help
      deploring such ostentation on the part of a Prince of the Church about to
      participate in such a solemn function.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I had heard him say made me curious to see him, and I kept on the
      watch for the moment of his departure. What a man! He was not only ill
      made, short and sun-burnt; but his face was so ugly and so low that I
      concluded that AEsop himself must have been a little Love beside his
      eminence. I understood now why he was so profuse in his generosity and
      decorations, for otherwise he might well have been taken for a stableboy.
      If the conclave took the eccentric whim of making him pope, Christ would
      never have an uglier vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enquired about the Marquis d&rsquo;Argens soon after the departure of his
      eminence, and was told that he was in the country with his brother, the
      Marquis d&rsquo;Eguille, President of the Parliament, so I went there.
    </p>
    <p>
      This marquis, famous for his friendship for Frederick II. rather than for
      his writings (which are no longer read), was an old man when I saw him. He
      was a worthy man, fond of pleasure, a thorough-paced Epicurean, and had
      married an actress named Cochois, who had proved worthy of the honour he
      had laid on her. He was deeply learned and had a thorough knowledge of
      Latin, Greek, and Hebrew literature. His memory was prodigious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He received me very well, and recalled what his friend the marshal had
      written about me. He introduced me to his wife and to his brother, a
      distinguished jurist, a man of letters, and a strictly moral man by
      temperament as much as religion. Though a highly intellectual man, he was
      deeply and sincerely religious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very fond of his brother, and grieved for his irreligion, but hoped
      that grace would eventually bring him back to the fold of the Church. His
      brother encouraged him in his hopes, while laughing at them in private,
      but as they were both sensible men they never discussed religion together.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was introduced to a numerous company of both sexes, chiefly consisting
      of relations. All were amiable and highly polished, like all the Provencal
      nobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plays were performed on the miniature stage, good cheer prevailed, and at
      intervals we walked in the garden, in spite of the weather. In Province,
      however, the winter is only severe when the wind blows from the north,
      which unfortunately often happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the company were a Berlin lady (widow of the marquis&rsquo;s nephew) and
      her brother. This young gentleman, who was gay and free from care, enjoyed
      all the pleasures of the house without paying any attention to the
      religious services which were held every day. If he thought on the matter
      at all, he was a heretic; and when the Jesuit chaplain was saying mass he
      amused himself by playing on the flute; he laughed at everything. He was
      unlike his sister, who had not only become a Catholic, but was a very
      devout one. She was only twenty-two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother told me that her husband, who had died of consumption, and
      whose mind was perfectly clear to the last, as is usually the case in
      phthisis, had told her that he could not entertain any hopes of seeing her
      in the other world unless she became a Catholic.
    </p>
    <p>
      These words were engraved on her heart; she had adored her husband, and
      she resolved to leave Berlin to live with his relations. No one ventured
      to oppose this design, her brother accompanying her, and she was welcomed
      joyfully by all her husband&rsquo;s kinsfolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      This budding saint was decidedly plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother, finding me less strict than the others, soon constituted
      himself my friend. He came over to Aix every day, and took me to the
      houses of all the best people.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were at least thirty at table every day, the dishes were delicate
      without undue profusion, the conversation gay and animated without any
      improprieties. I noticed that whenever the Marquis d&rsquo;Argens chanced to let
      slip any equivocal expressions, all the ladies made wry faces, and the
      chaplain hastened to turn the conversation. This chaplain had nothing
      jesuitical in his appearance; he dressed in the costume of an ordinary
      priest, and I should never had known him if the Marquis d&rsquo;Argens had not
      warned me. However, I did not allow his presence to act as a wet blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told, in the most decent manner possible, the story of the picture of
      the Virgin suckling her Divine Child, and how the Spaniards deserted the
      chapel after a stupid priest had covered the beautiful breast with a
      kerchief. I do not know how it was, but all the ladies began to laugh. The
      disciple of Loyola was so displeased at their mirth, that he took upon
      himself to tell me that it was unbecoming to tell such equivocal stories
      in public. I thanked him by an inclination of the head, and the Marquis
      d&rsquo;Argens, by way of turning the conversation, asked me what was the
      Italian for a splendid dish of stewed veal, which Madame d&rsquo;Argens was
      helping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Una crostata,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but I really do not know the Italian for the
      &lsquo;beatilles&rsquo; with which it is stuffed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These &lsquo;beatilles&rsquo; were balls of rice, veal, champignons, artichoke, foie
      gras, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jesuit declared that in calling them &lsquo;beatilles&rsquo; I was making a mock
      of the glories of hereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not help roaring with laughter at this, and the Marquis d&rsquo;Eguille
      took my part, and said that &lsquo;beatilles&rsquo; was the proper French for these
      balls.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this daring difference of opinion with his director, the worthy man
      thought it would be best to talk of something else. Unhappily, however, he
      fell out of the frying-pan into the fire by asking me my opinion as to the
      election of the next pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it will be Ganganelli,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;as he is the only monk in
      the conclave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should it be necessary to choose a monk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because none but a monk would dare to commit the excess which the
      Spaniards will demand of the new pope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the suppression of the Jesuits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will never obtain such a demand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not, for the Jesuits were my masters, and I love them accordingly.
      But all the same Ganganelli will be elected, for an amusing and yet a
      weighty reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us the reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the only cardinal who does not wear a wig; and you must consider
      that since the foundation of the Holy See the Pope has never been
      bewigged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This reason created a great deal of amusement; but the conversation was
      brought back to the suppression of the Jesuits, and when I told the
      company that I had heard from the Abbe Pinzi I saw the Jesuit turn pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Pope could never suppress the order,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems that you have never been at a Jesuit seminary,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;for
      the dogma of the order is that the Pope can do everything, &lsquo;et aliquid
      pluris&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This answer made everybody suppose me to be unaware that I was speaking to
      a Jesuit, and as he gave me no answer the topic was abandoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner I was asked to stay and see &lsquo;Polieucte&rsquo; played; but I excused
      myself, and returned to Aix with the young Berliner, who told me the story
      of his sister, and made me acquainted with the character of the society to
      which the Marquis d&rsquo;Eguille was chiefly addicted. I felt that I could
      never adapt myself to their prejudices, and if it had not been for my
      young friend, who introduced me to some charming people, I should have
      gone on to Marseilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      What with assemblies, balls, suppers, and the society of the handsome
      Provenqal ladies, I managed to spend the whole of the carnival and a part
      of Lent at Aix.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had made a present of a copy of the &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; to the learned Marquis
      d&rsquo;Argens; to his daughter, who was also a good scholar, I gave a Latin
      tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; had Porphyry&rsquo;s comment; it was a copy of a rare edition, and
      was richly bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the marquis came to Aix to thank me, I had to pay another visit to the
      country house.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening I drove back in an open carriage. I had no cloak, and a
      cold north wind was blowing; I was perishing with cold, but instead of
      going to bed at once I accompanied the Berliner to the house of a woman
      who had a daughter of the utmost beauty. Though the girl was only
      fourteen, she had all the indications of the marriageable age, and yet
      none of the Provencal amateurs had succeeded in making her see daylight.
      My friend had already made several unsuccessful efforts. I laughed at him,
      as I knew it was all a cheat, and I followed him to the house with the
      idea of making the young imposter dismount from her high horse, as I had
      done in similar cases in England and Metz.
    </p>
    <p>
      We set to work; and, far from resisting, the girl said she would be only
      too glad to get rid of the troublesome burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that the difficulty only proceeded from the way she held herself,
      and I ought to have whipped her, as I had done in Venice twenty-five years
      ago, but I was foolish enough to try to take the citadel by storm. But my
      age of miracles was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wearied myself to no purpose for a couple of hours, and then went to my
      inn, leaving the young Prussian to do his best.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to bed with a pain in my side, and after six hours&rsquo; sleep awoke
      feeling thoroughly ill. I had pleurisy. My landlord called in an old
      doctor, who refused to let me blood. A severe cough came on, and the next
      day I began to spit blood. In six or seven days the malady became so
      serious that I was confessed and received the last sacraments.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the tenth day, the disease having abated for three days, my clever old
      doctor answered for my life, but I continued to spit blood till the
      eighteenth day.
    </p>
    <p>
      My convalescence lasted for three weeks, and I found it more trying than
      the actual illness, for a man in pain has no time to grow weary.
      Throughout the whole case I was tended day and night by a strange woman,
      of whom I knew nothing. She nursed me with the tenderest care, and I
      awaited my recovery to give her my sincere thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not an old woman, neither was she attractive looking. She had
      slept in my room all the time. After Eastertide, feeling I was well enough
      to venture out, I thanked her to the best of my ability, and asked who had
      sent her to me. She told me it was the doctor, and so bade me farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later I was thanking my old doctor for having procured me such
      a capital nurse, but he stared at me and said he knew nothing about the
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was puzzled, and asked my landlord if she could throw any light on the
      strange nurse&rsquo;s identity; but she knew nothing, and her ignorance seemed
      universal. I could not discover whence or how she came to attend me.
    </p>
    <p>
      After my convalescence I took care to get all the letters which had been
      awaiting me, and amongst them was a letter from my brother in Paris, in
      answer to the epistle I wrote him from Perpignan. He acknowledged my
      letter, and told me how delighted he had been to receive it, after hearing
      the dreadful news that I had been assassinated on the borders of Catalonia
      at the beginning of January.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The person who gave me the news,&rdquo; my brother added, &ldquo;was one of your best
      friends, Count Manucci, an attache at the Venetian embassy. He said there
      could be no doubt as to the truth of the report.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This letter was like a flash of lightning to me. This friend of mine had
      pushed his vengeance so far as to pay assassins to deprive me of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manucci had gone a little too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have been pretty well qualified to prophesy, as he was so certain
      of my death. He might have known that in thus proclaiming in advance the
      manner of my death, he was also proclaiming himself as my murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I met him at Rome, two years later, and when I would have made him confess
      his guilt, he denied everything, saying he had received the news from
      Barcelona; however, we will speak of this in its proper place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dined and supped every day at the table d&rsquo;hote, and one day I heard the
      company talking of a male and female pilgrim who had recently arrived.
      They were Italians, and were returning from St. James of Compostella. They
      were said to be high-born folks, as they had distributed large alms on
      their entry into the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said that the female pilgrim, who had gone to bed on her arrival,
      was charming. They were staying at the same inn as I was, and we all got
      very curious about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an Italian, I put myself at the head of the band who proceeded to call
      on the pilgrims, who, in my opinion, must either be fanatics or rogues.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found the lady sitting in an arm-chair, looking very tired. She was
      young, beautiful, and melancholy-looking, and in her hands she held a
      brass crucifix some six inches long. She laid it down when we came in, and
      got up and received us most graciously. Her companion, who was arranging
      cockle-shells on his black mantle, did not stir; he seemed to say, by
      glancing at his wife, that we must confine our attentions to her. He
      seemed a man of twenty-four or twenty-five years of age. He was short and
      badly hung, and his face bore all the indications of daring, impudence,
      sarcasm, and imposture. His wife, on the other hand, was all meekness and
      simplicity, and had that modesty which adds so much to the charm of
      feminine beauty. They only spoke just enough French to make themselves
      understood on their journey, and when they heard me addressing them in
      Italian they seemed much relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady told me she was a Roman, but I could have guessed as much from
      her accent. I judged the man to be a Neapolitan or Sicilian. Their
      passport, dated Rome, called him Balsamo, while she bore the names of
      Serafina Feliciani, which she still retains. Ten years later we shall hear
      more of this couple under the name of Cagliostro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going back to Rome,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;well pleased with our devotions to
      St. James of Compostella and to Our Lady del Pilar. We have walked the
      whole way on foot, living on alms, so as to more surely win the mercy of
      the God whom I have offended so grievously. We have had silver, and even
      gold money given us, and in every town we came to we gave what remained to
      the poor, so as not to offend God by lack of faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband is strong, and has not suffered much, but I have found so much
      walking very fatiguing. We have slept on straw or bad beds, always with
      our clothes on, to avoid contracting diseases it would be hard to rid
      one&rsquo;s self of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to me that this last circumstance was added to make us wish to
      find out whether the rest of her body could compare with her hands and
      arms in whiteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think of making any stay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My weariness will oblige us to stay here for three days; then we shall go
      to Rome by the way of Turin, where we shall pay our devotion to the Holy
      Sudary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, of course, that there are several of them in Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we have heard, but we are assured that the Sudary of Turin is the true
      one. It is the kerchief with which St. Veronica wiped the face of Our
      Lord, who left the imprint of His divine face upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We left them, well pleased with the appearance and manners of the lady
      pilgrim, but placing very little trust in her devotion. I was still weak
      from my illness, and she inspired me with no desires, but the rest would
      have gladly supped with her if they had thought there was anything to
      follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day her husband asked me if I would come up and breakfast with them,
      or if they should come down and breakfast with me. It would have been
      impolite to have replied neither, so I said that I should be delighted to
      see them in my room.
    </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast I asked the pilgrim what he did, and he replied that he was
      an artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not design a picture, but he could copy it, and he assured me
      that he could copy an engraving so exactly that none could tell the copy
      from the original.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you. If you are not a rich man, you are, at least, certain
      of earning a living with this talent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody says the same, but it is a mistake. I have pursued this craft
      at Rome and at Naples, and found I had to work all day to make half a
      tester, and that&rsquo;s not enough to live on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then shewed me some fans he had done, and I thought them most
      beautiful. They were done in pen and ink, and the finest copper-plate
      could not have surpassed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next he showed me a copy from a Rembrandt, which if anything, was finer
      than the original. In spite of all he swore that the work he got barely
      supported him, but I did not believe what he said. He was a weak genius
      who preferred a vagabond life to methodical labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I offered a Louis for one of his fans, but he refused to take it, begging
      me to accept the fan as a gift, and to make a collection for him at the
      table d&rsquo;hote, as he wanted to start the day after next.
    </p>
    <p>
      I accepted the present and promised to do as he desired, and succeeded in
      making up a purse of two hundred francs for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman had the most virtuous air. She was asked to write her name on a
      lottery ticket, but refused, saying that no honest girls were taught to
      write at Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody laughed at this excuse except myself, and I pitied her, as I
      could see that she was of very low origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day she came and asked me to give her a letter of introduction for
      Avignon. I wrote her out two; one to M. Audifret the banker, and the other
      to the landlady of the inn. In the evening she returned me the letter to
      the banker, saying that it was not necessary for their purposes. At the
      same time she asked me to examine the letter closely, to see if it was
      really the same document I had given her. I did so, and said I was sure it
      was my letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, and told me I was mistaken as it was only a copy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She called her husband, who came with the letter in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could doubt no longer, and said to him,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a man of talents, for it is much harder to imitate a handwriting
      than an engraving. You ought to make this talent serve you in good stead;
      but be careful, or it may cost you your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day the couple left Aix. In ten years I saw them again under the
      name of Count and Countess Pellegrini.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the present period he is in a prison which he will probably never
      leave, and his wife is happy, maybe, in a convent.

     My Departure&mdash;Letter from Henriette&mdash;Marsellies&mdash;History of
     Nina&mdash;Nice&mdash;Turin&mdash;Lugano&mdash;Madame De****
</pre>
    <p>
      As soon as I had regained my usual strength, I went to take leave of the
      Marquis d&rsquo;Argens and his brother. I dined with them, pretending not to
      observe the presence of the Jesuit, and I then spent three delightful
      hours in conversation with the learned and amiable Marquis d&rsquo;Argens. He
      told me a number of interesting anecdotes about the private life of
      Frederick II. No doubt the reader would like to have them, but I lack the
      energy to set them down. Perhaps some other day when the mists about Dux
      have dispersed, and some rays of the sun shine in upon me, I shall commit
      all these anecdotes to paper, but now I have not the courage to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederick had his good and his bad qualities, like all great men, but when
      every deduction on the score of his failings has been made, he still
      remains the noblest figure in the eighteenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King of Sweden, who has been assassinated, loved to excite hatred that
      he might have the glory of defying it to do its worst. He was a despot at
      heart, and he came to a despot&rsquo;s end. He might have foreseen a violent
      death, for throughout his life he was always provoking men to the point of
      despair. There can be no comparison between him and Frederick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis d&rsquo;Argens made me a present of all his works, and on my asking
      him if I could congratulate myself on possessing the whole number, he said
      yes, with the exception of a fragment of autobiography which he had
      written in his youth, and which he had afterwards suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I was foolish enough to write the truth. Never give way to this
      temptation, if it assails you. If you once begin on this plan you are not
      only compelled to record all your vices and follies, but to treat them in
      the severe tone of a philosophical historian. You must not, of course,
      omit the good you may have done; and so praise and blame is mingled on
      every page. All the evil you say of yourself will be held for gospel, your
      peccadilloes will be made into crimes, and your good deeds will not only
      be received with incredulity, but you will be taxed with pride and vanity
      for having recorded them. Besides, if you write your memoirs, you make an
      enemy in every chapter if you once begin to tell the truth. A man should
      neither talk of himself nor write of himself, unless it be to refute some
      calumny or libel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was convinced, and promised never to be guilty of such a folly, but in
      spite of that I have been writing memoirs for the last seven years, and
      though I repent of having begun, I have sworn to go on to the end.
      However, I write in the hope that my Memoirs may never see the light of
      day; in the first place the censure would not allow them to be printed,
      and in the second I hope I shall be strong-minded enough, when my last
      illness comes, to have all my papers burnt before my eyes. If that be not
      the case I count on the indulgence of my readers, who should remember that
      I have only written my story to prevent my going mad in the midst of all
      the petty insults and disagreeables which I have to bear day by day from
      the envious rascals who live with me in this castle of Count Waldstein, or
      Wallenstein, at Dux.
    </p>
    <p>
      I write ten or twelve hours a day, and so keep black melancholy at bay. My
      readers shall hear more of my sufferings later on, if I do not die before
      I write them down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after Corpus Christi I left Aix for Marseilles. But here I must
      set down a circumstance that I had forgotten; I mean the procession of
      Corpus Christi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone knows that this festival is celebrated with great ceremony all
      over Christendom; but at Aix these ceremonies are of such a nature that
      every man of sense must be shocked at my recital.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is well known that this procession in honour of the Being of beings,
      represented under the sacramental forms, is followed by all the religious
      confraternities, and this is duly done at Aix; but the scandalous part of
      the ceremony is the folly and the buffoonery which is allowed in a rite
      which should be designed to stir up the hearts of men to awe and reverence
      their Creator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of that, the devil, death, and the seven deadly sins, are
      impersonated in the procession. They are clad in the most absurd costumes,
      and make hideous contortions, beating and abusing each other in their
      supposed vexation at having to join in the Creator&rsquo;s praises. The people
      hoot and hiss them, the lower classes sing songs in derision of them, and
      play them all manner of tricks, and the whole scene is one of incredible
      noise, uproar, and confusion, more worthy of some pagan bacchanalia than a
      procession of Christian people. All the country-folk from five or six
      leagues around Aix pour into the town on that day to do honour to God. It
      is the only occasion of the kind, and the clergy, either knavish or
      ignorant, encourage all this shameful riot. The lower orders take it all
      in good faith, and anyone who raised any objection would run some risk,
      for the bishop goes in front of the saturnalia, and consequently it is all
      holy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I expressed my disapproval of the whole affair, as likely to bring
      discredit on religion, to a councillor of parliament, M. de St. Marc; but
      he told me gravely that it was an excellent thing, as it brought no less
      than a hundred thousand francs into the town on the single day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could find no reply to this very weighty reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day I spent at Aix I thought of Henriette. I knew her real name, and
      remembering the message she had sent me by Marcoline I hoped to meet her
      in some assembly, being ready to adapt my conduct to hers. I had often
      heard her name mentioned, but I never allowed myself to ask any question,
      not wishing our old friendship to be suspected. Believing her to be at her
      country house, I had resolved on paying her a visit, and had only stayed
      on at Aix so as to recover my health before seeing her. In due course I
      left Aix with a letter in my pocket for her, resolving to send it in, and
      to remain in my carriage till she asked me to get down.
    </p>
    <p>
      We arrived at her residence at eleven o&rsquo;clock. A man came to the door,
      took my letter, and said madam should have it without fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she is not here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; she is at Aix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the last six months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does she live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In her town house. She will be coming here in three weeks to spend the
      summer as usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you let me write a letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will get down you will find all the necessary materials in madam&rsquo;s
      room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went into the house, and to my extreme surprise found myself face to
      face with my nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You live here, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the last ten years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come to nurse me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will step upstairs I will tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her story was as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam sent for me in haste, and told me to go and attend to you as if it
      were herself. She told me to say that the doctor had sent me if you asked
      any questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor said he didn&rsquo;t know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he was speaking the truth, but most likely he had received orders
      from madam. That&rsquo;s all I know, but I wonder you haven&rsquo;t seen her at Aix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She cannot see any company, for I have been everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does not see any company at her own house, but she goes everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very strange. I must have seen her, and yet I do not think I could
      have passed her by unrecognized. You have been with her ten years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, as I had the honour of informing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she changed? Has she had any sickness? Has she aged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. She has become rather stout, but I assure you you would take
      her for a woman of thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be blind, or I cannot have seen her. I am going to write to her
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman went out, leaving me in astonishment, at the extraordinary
      situation in which I was placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ought I to return to Aix immediately?&rdquo; I asked myself. She has a town
      house, but does not see company, but she might surely see me: She loves me
      still. She cared for me all through my illness, and she would not have
      done so if she had become indifferent to me. She will be hurt at my not
      recognizing her. She must know that I have left Aix, and will no doubt
      guess that I am here now. Shall I go to her or shall I write? I resolved
      to write, and I told her in my letter that I should await her reply at
      Marseilles. I gave the letter to my late nurse, with some money to insure
      its being dispatched at once, and drove on to Marseilles where I alighted
      at an obscure inn, not wishing to be recognized. I had scarcely got out of
      my carriage when I saw Madame Schizza, Nina&rsquo;s sister. She had left
      Barcelona with her husband. They had been at Marseilles three or four days
      and were going to Leghorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Schizza was alone at the moment, her husband having gone out; and
      as I was full of curiosity I begged her to come up to my room while my
      dinner was getting ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your sister doing? Is she still at Barcelona?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but she will not be there long, for the bishop will not have her in
      the town or the diocese, and the bishop is stronger than the viceroy. She
      only returned to Barcelona on the plea that she wished to pass through
      Catalonia of her way home, but she does not need to stay there for nine or
      ten months on that account. She will have to leave in a month for certain,
      but she is not much put out, as the viceroy is sure to keep her wherever
      she goes, and she may eventually succeed in ruining him. In the meanwhile
      she is revelling in the bad repute she has gained for her lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know something of her peculiarities; but she cannot dislike a man who
      has made her rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rich! She has only got her diamonds. Do you imagine this monster capable
      of any feelings of gratitude? She is not a human being, and no one knows
      her as I do. She has made the count commit a hundred acts of injustice so
      that all Spain may talk of her, and know that she has made herself
      mistress of his body and soul, and all he has. The worse his actions are,
      the more certain she feels that people will talk of her, and that is all
      she wants. Her obligations to me are beyond counting, for she owes me all,
      even to her existence, and instead of continuing my husband in her service
      she has sent him about his business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I wonder how she came to treat me so generously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you knew all, you would not feel grateful to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me all, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She only paid for your keep at the inn and in prison to make people
      believe you were her lover, and to shame the count. All Barcelona knows
      that you were assassinated at her door, and that you were fortunate enough
      to run the fellow through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she cannot have been the instigator of, or even the accomplice in,
      the plot for my assassination. That&rsquo;s against nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say, but everything in Nina is against nature. What I tell you is
      the bare truth, for I was a witness of it all. Whenever the viceroy
      visited her she wearied him with praise of your gallantry, your wit, your
      noble actions, comparing you with the Spaniards, greatly to their
      disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The count got impatient and told her to talk of something else, but she
      would not; and at last he went away, cursing your name. Two days before
      you came to grief he left her, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Valga me Dios! I will give you a pleasure you do not expect.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you that when we heard the pistol-shot after you had gone, she
      remarked, without evincing the slightest emotion, that the shot was the
      pleasure her rascally Spaniard had promised her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that you might be killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;All the worse for the count,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;for his turn will come
      also.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she began laughing like a madcap; she was thinking of the excitement
      your death would cause in Barcelona.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At eight o&rsquo;clock the following day, your man came and told her that you
      had been taken to the citadel; and I will say it to her credit, she seemed
      relieved to hear you were alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My man&mdash;I did not know that he was in correspondence with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I suppose not; but I assure you the worthy man was very much attached
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure he was. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nina then wrote a note to your landlord. She did not shew it me, but it
      no doubt contained instructions to supply you with everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man told us that he had seen your sword all red with blood, and that
      your cloak had a bullet hole through it. She was delighted, but do not
      think it was because she loved you; she was glad you had escaped that you
      might take your revenge. However, she was troubled by the pretext on which
      the count had had you arrested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ricla did not come to see her that day, but he came the next day at eight
      o&rsquo;clock, and the infamous creature received him with a smiling face. She
      told him she had heard he had imprisoned you, and that she was obliged to
      him, as he had, of course, done so to protect you from any fresh attempts
      on your life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He answered, dryly, that your arrest had nothing to do with anything that
      might have happened the night before. He added that you had only been
      seized pending the examination of your papers, and that if they were found
      to be in good form, you would be set at liberty in the course of a few
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nina asked him who was the man that you had wounded. He replied that the
      police were enquiring into the matter, but that so far they had neither
      found a dead man nor a wounded man, nor any traces of blood. All that had
      been found was Casanova&rsquo;s hat, and this had been returned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left them alone together till midnight, so I cannot say what further
      converse they may have had on the subject, but three or four days later
      everybody knew that you were imprisoned in the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nina asked the count the reason of this severity in the evening, and he
      replied that your passports were thought to be forgeries, because you were
      in disgrace with the State Inquisitors, and therefore would not be in a
      position to get a passport from the Venetian ambassador. On this
      supposition he said you had been placed in the tower, and if it proved to
      be a true one, you would be still more severely punished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This news disturbed us, and when we heard that Pogomas had been arrested
      we felt certain he had denounced you in revenge for your having procured
      his dismissal from Nina&rsquo;s house. When we heard that he had been let out
      and sent to Genoa, we expected to hear of your being set at liberty, as
      the authorities must have been satisfied of the genuine character of your
      passports; but you were still shut up, and Nina did not know what to
      think, and the count would not answer her when she made enquiries about
      you. She had made up her mind to say no more about it, when at last we
      heard you had been set free and that your passports had been declared
      genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nina thought to see you in the pit of the opera-house, and made
      preparations for a triumph in her box; but she was in despair when she
      heard no performance was to be given. In the evening the count told her
      that your passports had been returned with the order to leave in three
      days. The false creature praised her lover&rsquo;s prudence to his face, but she
      cursed him in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knew you would not dare to see her, and when you left without writing
      her a note, she said you had received secret orders not to hold any
      further communications with her. She was furious with the viceroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If Casanova had had the courage to ask me to go with him, I would have
      gone,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your man told her of your fortunate escape from three assassins. In the
      evening she congratulated Ricla on the circumstance, but he swore he knew
      nothing about it. Nina did not believe him. You may thank God from the
      bottom of your heart that you ever left Spain alive after knowing Nina.
      She would have cost you your life at last, and she punishes me for having
      given her life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Are you her mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Nina, that horrible woman, is my daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? Everybody says you are her sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the horrible part of it, everybody is right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, though it is to my shame. She is my sister and my daughter, for she
      is the daughter of my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! your father loved you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know whether the scoundrel loved me, but he treated me as his
      wife. I was sixteen then. She is the daughter of the crime, and God knows
      she is sufficient punishment for it. My father died to escape her
      vengeance; may he also escape the vengeance of God. I should have
      strangled her in her cradle, but maybe I shall strangle her yet. If I do
      not, she will kill me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I remained dumb at the conclusion of this dreadful story, which bore all
      the marks of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Nina know that you are her mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her own father told her the secret when she was twelve, after he had
      initiated her into the life she has been living ever since. He would have
      made her a mother in her turn if he had not killed himself the same year,
      maybe to escape the gallows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did the Conte de Ricla fall in love with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a short story and a curious one. Two years ago she came to
      Barcelona from Portugal, and was placed in one of the ballets for the sake
      of her pretty face, for as to talents she had none, and could only do the
      rebaltade (a sort of skip and pirouette) properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first evening she danced she was loudly applauded by the pit, for as
      she did the rebaltade she shewed her drawers up to her waist. In Spain any
      actress who shews her drawers on the stage is liable to a fine of a crown.
      Nina knew nothing about this, and, hearing the applause, treated the
      audience to another skip of the same kind, but at the end of the ballet
      she was told to pay two crowns for her immodesty. Nina cursed and swore,
      but she had to give in. What do you think she did to elude the law, and at
      the same time avenge herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Danced badly, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She danced without any drawers at all, and did her rebaltade as before,
      which caused such an effervescence of high spirits in the house as had
      never been known at Barcelona.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Conte de Ricla had seen her from his box, and was divided between
      horror and admiration, and sent for the inspector to tell him that this
      impudent creature must be punished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In the mean time,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;bring her before me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently Nina appeared in the viceroy&rsquo;s box, and asked him, impudently,
      what he wanted with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You are an immodest woman, and have failed in your duty to the public.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What have I done?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You performed the same skip as before.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, but I haven&rsquo;t broken your law, for no one can have seen my drawers
      as I took the precaution not to put any on. What more can I do for your
      cursed law, which has cost me two crowns already? Just tell me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The viceroy and the great personages around him had much ado to refrain
      from laughter, for Nina was really in the right, and a serious discussion
      of the violated law would have been ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The viceroy felt he was in a false position, and merely said that if she
      ever danced without drawers again she should have a month&rsquo;s imprisonment
      on bread and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A week after one of my husband&rsquo;s ballets was given. It was so well
      received that the audience encored it with enthusiasm. Ricla gave orders
      that the public should be satisfied, and all the dancers were told they
      would have to reappear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nina, who was almost undressed, told my husband to do as best he could,
      as she was not going to dance again. As she had the chief part my husband
      could not do without her, and sent the manager to her dressing-room. She
      pushed the poor man out with so much violence that he fell against the
      wall of the passage, head foremost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The manager told his piteous tale to the viceroy, who ordered two
      soldiers to bring her before him. This was his ruin; for Nina is a
      beautiful woman, and in her then state of undress she would have seduced
      the coldest of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The count reproved her, but his voice and his manner were ill-assured,
      and growing bolder as she watched his embarrassment, Nina replied that he
      might have her torn to pieces if he liked, but she would not dance against
      her will, and nowhere in her agreement was it stipulated that she should
      dance twice in the same evening, whether for his pleasure or anyone
      else&rsquo;s. She also expressed her anger at making her appear before him in a
      state of semi-nudity, and swore she would never forgive his barbarous and
      despotic conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I will dance no more before you or your people. Let me go away, or kill
      me if you like; do your worst on me, and you shall find that I am a
      Venetian and a free woman!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The viceroy sat astonished, and said she must be mad. He then summoned my
      husband and told him she was no longer in his service. Nina was told she
      was free, and could go where she would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went back to her dressing-room and came to us, where she was living.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ballet went on without her, and the poor viceroy sat in a dream, for
      the poison had entered into his veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next day a wretched singer named Molinari called on Nina and told her
      that the viceroy was anxious to know whether she were really mad or not,
      and would like to see her in a country house, the name of which he
      mentioned: this was just what the wretched woman wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tell his highness,&rsquo; she said to Molinari, &lsquo;that I will come, and that he
      will find me as gentle as a lamb and as good as an angel.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the way in which the connection began, and she fathomed his
      character so astutely that she maintained her conquest as much with
      ill-treatment and severity as with her favours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was the tale of the hapless Madame Schizza. It was told with all the
      passion of an Italian divided between repentance for the past and the
      desire of vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, as I had expected, I received a letter from Henriette. It
      ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Dear Old Friend,&mdash;Nothing could be more romantic than our meeting
      at my country house six years ago, and now again, after a parting of so
      many years. Naturally we have both grown older, and though I love you
      still I am glad you did not recognize me. Not that I have become ugly, but
      I am stout, and this gives me another look. I am a widow, and well enough
      off to tell you that if you lack money you will find some ready for you in
      Henriette&rsquo;s purse. Do not come back to Aix to see me, as your return might
      give rise to gossip; but if you chance to come here again after some time,
      we may meet, though not as old acquaintances. I am happy to think that I
      have perhaps prolonged your days by giving you a nurse for whose
      trustworthiness I would answer. If you would like to correspond with me I
      should be happy to do my part. I am very curious to know what happened to
      you after your flight from The Leads, and after the proofs you have given
      me of your discretion I think I shall be able to tell you how we came to
      meet at Cesena, and how I returned to my country. The first part is a
      secret for everyone; only M. d&rsquo;Antoine is acquainted with a portion of the
      story. I am grateful for the reticence you have observed, though Marcoline
      must have delivered the message I gave her. Tell me what has become of
      that beautiful girl. Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I replied, accepting her offer to correspond, and I told her the whole
      story of my adventures. From her I received forty letters, in which the
      history of her life is given. If she die before me, I shall add these
      letters to my Memoirs, but at present she is alive and happy, though
      advanced in years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after I went to call on Madame Audibert, and we went together to
      see Madame N&mdash;&mdash; N&mdash;&mdash;, who was already the mother of
      three children. Her husband adored her, and she was very happy. I gave her
      good news of Marcoline, and told the story of Croce and Charlotte&rsquo;s death,
      which affected her to tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      In turn she told me about Rosalie, who was quite a rich woman. I had no
      hopes of seeing her again, for she lived at Genoa, and I should not have
      cared to face M. Grimaldi.
    </p>
    <p>
      My niece (as I once called her) mortified me unintentionally; she said I
      was ageing. Though a man can easily make a jest of his advancing years, a
      speech like this is not pleasant when one has not abandoned the pursuit of
      pleasure. She gave me a capital dinner, and her husband made me offers
      which I was ashamed to accept. I had fifty Louis, and, intending to go on
      to Turin, I did not feel uneasy about the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Marseilles I met the Duc de Vilardi, who was kept alive by the art of
      Tronchin. This nobleman, who was Governor of Provence, asked me to supper,
      and I was surprised to meet at his house the self-styled Marquis d&rsquo;Aragon;
      he was engaged in holding the bank. I staked a few coins and lost, and the
      marquis asked me to dine with him and his wife, an elderly Englishwoman,
      who had brought him a dowry of forty thousand guineas absolutely, with
      twenty thousand guineas which would ultimately go to her son in London. I
      was not ashamed to borrow fifty Louis from this lucky rascal, though I
      felt almost certain that I should never return the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left Marseilles by myself, and after crossing the Alps arrived at Turin.
    </p>
    <p>
      There I had a warm welcome from the Chevalier Raiberti and the Comte de la
      Perouse. Both of them pronounced me to be looking older, but I consoled
      myself with the thought that, after all, I was only forty-four.
    </p>
    <p>
      I became an intimate friend of the English ambassador, Sir N&mdash;&mdash;,
      a rich, accomplished and cultured man, who kept the choicest of tables.
      Everybody loved him, and amongst others this feeling was warmly shared by
      a Parmese girl, named Campioni, who was wonderfully beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I had told my friends that I intended to go into Switzerland to
      print at my own expense a refutation in Italian of the &ldquo;History of the
      Venetian Government,&rdquo; by Amelot de la Houssaye, they all did their best by
      subscribing and obtaining subscriptions. The most generous of all was the
      Comte de la Perouse, who gave me two hundred and fifty francs for fifty
      copies. I left Turin in a week with two thousand lire in my purse. With
      this I should be able to print the book I had composed in my prison; but I
      should have to rewrite it &lsquo;ab initio&rsquo;, with the volume to my hand, as also
      the &ldquo;History of Venice,&rdquo; by Nani.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had got these works I set out with the intention of having my book
      printed at Lugano, as there was a good press there and no censure. I also
      knew that the head of the press was a well-read man, and that the place
      abounded in good cheer and good society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lugano is near Milan, Como, and Lake Maggiore, and I was well pleased with
      the situation. I went to the best inn, which was kept by a man named
      Tagoretti, who gave me the best room in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after my arrival I called on Dr. Agnelli, who was at once printer,
      priest, theologian, and an honest man. I made a regular agreement with
      him, he engaging to print at the rate of four sheets a week, and on my
      side I promised to pay him every week. He reserved the right of
      censorship, expressing a hope that our opinions might coincide.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave him the preface and the preliminary matter at once, and chose the
      paper and the size, large octavo.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got back to my inn the landlord told me that the bargello, or chief
      constable, wanted to see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Lugano is in Switzerland, its municipal government is modelled
      after that of the Italian towns.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was curious to hear what this ill-omened personage could have to say to
      me, so I told him to shew him in. After giving me a profound bow, with his
      hat in his hand, Signor Bargello told me that he had come to offer me his
      services, and to assure me that I should enjoy complete tranquillity and
      safety in Lugano, whether from any enemies within the State or from the
      Venetian Government, in case I had any dispute with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, signor,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and I am sure that you are telling me
      the truth, as I am in Switzerland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must take the liberty of telling you, sir, that it is customary for
      strangers who take up their residence in Lugano, to pay some trifling sum,
      either by the week, the month, or the year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if they refuse to pay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then their safety is not so sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money does everything in Lugano, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir&mdash;&mdash; &rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, but let me tell you that I have no fears, and I shall
      consequently beg to be excused from paying anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will forgive me, but I happen to know that you have some disputes
      with the Venetian Government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are making a mistake, my good fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are so sure, find someone to bet me two hundred sequins that I
      have reason to fear the Venetian Government; I will take the bet and
      deposit the amount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bargello remained silent, and the landlord told him he seemed to have
      made some kind of mistake, so he went away, looking very disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      My landlord was delighted to hear that I thought of making some stay at
      Lugano, and advised me to call on the high bailiff, who governed the
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very nice Swiss gentleman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and his wife a clever woman,
      and as fair as the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go and see him to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sent in my name to the high bailiff at noon on the day following, and
      what was my surprise to find myself in the presence of M. de R. and his
      charming wife. Beside her was a pretty boy, five or six years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mutual surprise may be imagined!

     The Punishment of Marazzani&mdash;I Leave Lugano&mdash;Turin&mdash;
     M. Dubois at Parma&mdash;Leghorn&mdash;The Duke of Orloff&mdash;Pisa&mdash;
     Stratico&mdash;Sienna&mdash;The Marchioness Chigi&mdash;My Departure from
     Sienna With an Englishwoman
</pre>
    <p>
      These unforeseen, haphazard meetings with old friends have always been the
      happiest moments of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all remained for some time dumb with delight. M. de R. was the first to
      break the silence by giving me a cordial embrace. We burst out into mutual
      excuses, he for having imagined that there might be other Casanovas in
      Italy, and I for not having ascertained his name. He made me take pot-luck
      with him the same day, and we seemed as if we had never parted. The
      Republic had given him this employ&mdash;a very lucrative one&mdash;and he
      was only sorry that it would expire in two years. He told me he was
      delighted to be able to be of use to me, and begged me to consider he was
      wholly at my service. He was delighted to hear that I should be engaged in
      seeing my work through the press for three or four months, and seemed
      vexed when I told him that I could not accept his hospitality more than
      once a week as my labours would be incessant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de R&mdash;&mdash; could scarcely recover from her surprise. It was
      nine years since I had seen her at Soleure, and then I thought her beauty
      must be at its zenith; but I was wrong, she was still more beautiful and I
      told her so. She shewed me her only child, who had been born four years
      after my departure. She cherished the child as the apple of her eye, and
      seemed likely to spoil it; but I heard, a few years ago, that this child
      is now an amiable and accomplished man.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a quarter of an hour Madame de R&mdash;&mdash; informed me of all that
      had happened at Soleure since my departure. Lebel had gone to Besancon,
      where he lived happily with his charming wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      She happened to observe in a casual way that I no longer looked as young
      as I had done at Soleure, and this made me regulate my conduct in a manner
      I might not otherwise have done. I did not let her beauty carry me away; I
      resisted the effect of her charms, and I was content to enjoy her
      friendship, and to be worthy of the friendship of her good husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work on which I was engaged demanded all my care and attention, and a
      love affair would have wasted most of my time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began work the next morning, and save for an hour&rsquo;s visit from M. de R&mdash;&mdash;
      I wrote on till nightfall. The next day I had the first proof-sheet with
      which I was well enough pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent the whole of the next month in my room, working assiduously, and
      only going out to mass on feast days, to dine with M. de R&mdash;&mdash;,
      and to walk with his wife and her child.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a month my first volume was printed and stitched, and the
      manuscript of the second volume was ready for the press. Towards the end
      of October the printer sent in the entire work in three volumes, and in
      less than a year the edition was sold out.
    </p>
    <p>
      My object was not so much to make money as to appease the wrath of the
      Venetian Inquisitors; I had gone all over Europe, and experienced a
      violent desire to see my native land once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelot de la Houssaye had written his book from the point of view of an
      enemy of Venice. His history was rather a satire, containing learned and
      slanderous observations mingled together. It had been published for
      seventy years, but hitherto no one had taken the trouble to refute it. If
      a Venetian had attempted to do so he would not have obtained permission
      from his Government to print it in the States of Venice, for the State
      policy is to allow no one to discuss the actions of the authorities,
      whether in praise or blame; consequently no writer had attempted to refute
      the French history, as it was well known that the refutation would be
      visited with punishment and not with reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      My position was an exceptional one. I had been persecuted by the Venetian
      Government, so no one could accuse me of being partial; and by my exposing
      the calumnies of Amelot before all Europe I hoped to gain a reward, which
      after all would only be an act of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been an exile for fourteen years, and I thought the Inquisitors
      would be glad to repair their injustice on the pretext of rewarding my
      patriotism.
    </p>
    <p>
      My readers will see that my hopes were fulfilled, but I had to wait for
      five more years instead of receiving permission to return at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Bragadin was dead, and Dandolo and Barbaro were the only friends I
      had left at Venice; and with their aid I contrived to subscribe fifty
      copies of my book in my native town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout my stay at Lugano I only frequented the house of M. de R&mdash;&mdash;,
      where I saw the Abbe Riva, a learned and discreet man, to whom I had been
      commended by M. Querini, his relation. The abbe enjoyed such a reputation
      for wisdom amongst his fellow-countrymen that he was a kind of arbiter in
      all disputes, and thus the expenses of the law were saved. It was no
      wonder that the gentlemen of the long robe hated him most cordially. His
      nephew, Jean Baptiste Riva, was a friend of the Muses, of Bacchus, and of
      Venus; he was also a friend of mine, though I could not match him with the
      bottles. He lent me all the nymphs he had initiated into the mysteries,
      and they liked him all the better, as I made them some small presents.
      With him and his two pretty sisters I went to the Borromean Isles. I knew
      that Count Borromeo, who had honoured me with his friendship at Turin, was
      there, and from him I felt certain of a warm welcome. One of the two
      sisters had to pass for Riva&rsquo;s wife, and the other for his sister-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the count was a ruined man he lived in his isles like a prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be impossible to describe these Islands of the Blest; they must
      be seen to be imagined. The inhabitants enjoy an everlasting spring; there
      is neither heat nor cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count regaled us choicely, and amused the two girls by giving them
      rods and lines and letting them fish. Although he was ugly, old, and
      ruined, he still possessed the art of pleasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way back to Lugano, as I was making place for a carriage in a
      narrow road, my horse slipped and fell down a slope ten feet high. My head
      went against a large stone, and I thought my last hour was come as the
      blood poured out of the wound. However, I was well again in a few days.
      This was my last ride on horseback.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my stay at Lugano the inspectors of the Swiss cantons came there in
      its turn. The people dignified them with the magnificent title of
      ambassadors, but M. de R&mdash;&mdash; was content to call them avoyers.
    </p>
    <p>
      These gentlemen stayed at my inn, and I had my meals with them throughout
      their stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The avoyer of Berne gave me some news of my poor friend M. F&mdash;&mdash;.
      His charming daughter Sara had become the wife of M, de V&mdash;&mdash;,
      and was happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after these pleasant and cultured men had left, I was startled
      one morning by the sudden appearance of the wretched Marazzani in my room.
      I seized him by his collar, threw him out, and before he had time to use
      his cane or his sword, I had kicked, beaten, and boxed him most soundly.
      He defended himself to the best of his ability, and the landlord and his
      men ran up at the noise, and had some difficulty in separating us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him go!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;send for the bargello and have him away to
      prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I dressed myself hastily, and as I was going out to see M. de R&mdash;&mdash;,
      the bargello met me, and asked me on what charge I gave the man into
      custody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will hear that at M. de R&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s, where I shall await you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I must now explain my anger. You may remember, reader, that I left the
      wretched fellow in the prison of Buen Retiro. I heard afterwards that the
      King of Spain, Jerusalem, and the Canary Islands, had given him a small
      post in a galley off the coast of Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had done me no harm, and I pitied him; but not being his intimate
      friend, and having no power to mitigate the hardship of his lot, I had
      well-nigh forgotten him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight months after, I met at Barcelona Madame Bellucci, a Venetian dancer,
      with whom I had had a small intrigue. She gave an exclamation of delight
      on seeing me, and said she was glad to see me delivered from the hard fate
      to which a tyrannous Government had condemned me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fate is that?&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;I have seen a good deal of misfortune since
      I left you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean the presidio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that has never been my lot, thank God! Who told you such a story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Count Marazzani, who was here three weeks ago, and told me he had been
      luckier than you, as he had made his escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a liar and a scoundrel; and if ever I meet him again he shall pay me
      dearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From that moment I never thought of the rascal without feeling a lively
      desire to give him a thrashing, but I never thought that chance would
      bring about so early a meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the circumstances I think my behaviour will be thought only natural.
      I had beaten him, but that was not enough for me. I seemed to have done
      nothing, and indeed, I had got as good as I gave.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time he was in prison, and I went to M. de R&mdash;&mdash; to
      see what he could do for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as M. de R. heard my statement he said he could neither keep him in
      prison nor drive him out of the town unless I laid a plea before him,
      craving protection against this man, whom I believed to have come to
      Lugano with the purpose of assassinating me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can make the document more effective,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;by placing your
      actual grievance in a strong light, and laying stress on his sudden
      appearance in your room without sending in his name. That&rsquo;s what you had
      better do, and it remains to be seen how I shall answer your plea. I shall
      ask him for his passport and delay the case, and order him to be severely
      treated; but in the end I shall only be able to drive him out of the town,
      unless he can find good bail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could ask no more. I sent in my plea, and the next day I had the
      pleasure of seeing him brought into the court bound hand and foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de R. began to examine him, and Marazzani swore he had no evil
      intentions in calling on me. As to the calumny, he protested he had only
      repeated common rumour, and professed his joy at finding it had been
      mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ought to have been enough for me, but I continued obdurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de R&mdash;&mdash; said the fact of my being sent to the galleys having
      been rumoured was no justification for his repeating it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And furthermore,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;M. Casanova&rsquo;s suspicion that you were
      going to assassinate him is justified by your giving a false name, for the
      plaintiff maintains that you are not Count Marazzani at all. He offers to
      furnish surety on this behalf, and if M. Casanova does you wrong, his bail
      will escheat to you as damages. In the mean time you will remain in prison
      till we have further information about your real status.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was taken back, and as the poor devil had not a penny in his pocket it
      would have been superfluous to tell the bargedlo to treat him severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de R. wrote to the Swiss agent at Parma to obtain the necessary
      information; but as the rascal knew this would be against him, he wrote me
      a humble letter, in which he confessed that he was the son of a poor
      shopkeeper of Bobbio, and although his name was really Marazzani, he had
      nothing to do with the Marazzanis of Plaisance. He begged me to set him at
      liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shewed the letter to M. de R&mdash;&mdash;, who let him out of prison
      with orders to leave Lugano in twenty-four hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought I had been rather too harsh with him, and gave the poor devil
      some money to take him to Augsburg, and also a letter for M. de Sellentin,
      who was recruiting there for the Prussian king. We shall hear of Marazzani
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chevalier de Breche came to the Lugano Fair to buy some horses, and
      stopped a fortnight. I often met him at M. de R&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s, for whose
      wife he had a great admiration, and I was sorry to see him go.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left Lugano myself a few days later, having made up my mind to winter in
      Turin, where I hoped to see some pleasant society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I left I received a friendly letter from Prince Lubomirski, with a
      bill for a hundred ducats, in payment of fifty copies of my book. The
      prince had become lord high marshal on the death of Count Bilinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got to Turin I found a letter from the noble Venetian M. Girolamo
      Zulian, the same that had given me an introduction to Mocenigo. His letter
      contained an enclosure to M. Berlendis, the representative of the Republic
      at Turin, who thanked me for having enabled him to receive me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ambassador, a rich man, and a great lover of the fair sex, kept up a
      splendid establishment, and this was enough for his Government, for
      intelligence is not considered a necessary qualification for a Venetian
      ambassador. Indeed it is a positive disadvantage, and a witty ambassador
      would no doubt fall into disgrace with the Venetian Senate. However,
      Berlendis ran no risk whatever on this score; the realm of wit was an
      unknown land to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got this ambassador to call the attention of his Government to the work
      I had recently published, and the answer the State Inquisitors gave may
      astonish my readers, but it did not astonish me. The secretary of the
      famous and accursed Tribunal wrote to say that he had done well to call
      the attention of the Inquisitors to this work, as the author&rsquo;s presumption
      appeared on the title-page. He added that the work would be examined, and
      in the mean time the ambassador was instructed to shew me no signal marks
      of favour lest the Court should suppose he was protecting me as a
      Venetian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, it was the same tribunal that had facilitated my access to
      the ambassador to Madrid&mdash;Mocenigo.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told Berlendis that my visits should be limited in number, and free from
      all ostentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was much interested in his son&rsquo;s tutor; he was a priest, a man of
      letters, and a poet. His name was Andreis, and he is now resident in
      England, where he enjoys full liberty, the greatest of all blessings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent my time at Turin very pleasantly, in the midst of a small circle
      of Epicureans; there were the old Chevalier Raiberti, the Comte de la
      Perouse, a certain Abbe Roubien, a delightful man, the voluptuous Comte de
      Riva, and the English ambassador. To the amusements which this society
      afforded I added a course of reading, but no love affairs whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was at Turin, a milliner, Perouse&rsquo;s mistress, feeling herself in
      &lsquo;articulo mortis&rsquo;, swallowed the portrait of her lover instead of the
      Eucharist. This incident made me compose two sonnets, which pleased me a
      good deal at the time, and with which I am still satisfied. No doubt some
      will say that every poet is pleased with his own handiwork, but as a
      matter of fact, the severest critic of a sensible author is himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russian squadron, under the command of Count Alexis Orloff, was then
      at Leghorn; this squadron threatened Constantinople, and would probably
      have taken it if an Englishman had been in command.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I had known Count Orloff in Russia, I imagined that I might possibly
      render myself of service to him, and at the same time make my fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English ambassador having given me a letter for the English consul, I
      left Turin with very little money in my purse and no letter of credit on
      any banker.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Englishman named Acton commended me to an English banker at Leghorn,
      but this letter did not empower me to draw any supplies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acton was just then involved in a curious complication. When he was at
      Venice he had fallen in love with a pretty woman, either a Greek or a
      Neapolitan. The husband, by birth a native of Turin, and by profession a
      good-for-nothing, placed no obstacle in Acton&rsquo;s way, as the Englishman was
      generous with his money; but he had a knack of turning up at those moments
      when his absence would have been most desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The generous but proud and impatient Englishman could not be expected to
      bear this for long. He consulted with the lady, and determined to shew his
      teeth. The husband persisted in his untimely visits, and one day Acton
      said, dryly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want a thousand guineas? You can have them if you like, on the
      condition that your wife travels with me for three years without our
      having the pleasure of your society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The husband thought the bargain a good one, and signed an agreement to
      that effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the three years were over the husband wrote to his wife, who was at
      Venice, to return to him, and to Acton to put no obstacle in the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady replied that she did not want to live with him any more, and
      Acton explained to the husband that he could not be expected to drive his
      mistress away against her will. He foresaw, however, that the husband
      would complain to the English ambassador, and determined to be
      before-handed with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due course the husband did apply to the English ambassador, requesting
      him to compel Acton to restore to him his lawful wife. He even asked the
      Chevalier Raiberti to write to the Commendatore Camarana, the Sardinian
      ambassador at Venice, to apply pressure on the Venetian Government, and he
      would doubtless have succeeded if M. Raiberti had done him this favour.
      However, as it was he did nothing of the sort, and even gave Acton a warm
      welcome when he came to Turin to look into the matter. He had left his
      mistress at Venice under the protection of the English consul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband was ashamed to complain publicly, as he would have been
      confronted with the disgraceful agreement he had signed; but Berlendis
      maintained that he was in the right, and argued the question in the most
      amusing manner. On the one hand he urged the sacred and inviolable
      character of the marriage rite, and on the other he shewed how the wife
      was bound to submit to her husband in all things. I argued the matter with
      him myself, shewing him his disgraceful position in defending a man who
      traded on his wife&rsquo;s charms, and he was obliged to give in when I assured
      him that the husband had offered to renew the lease for the same time and
      on the same terms as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years later I met Acton at Bologna, and admired the beauty whom he
      considered and treated as his wife. She held on her knees a fine little
      Acton.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left Turin for Parma with a Venetian who, like myself, was an exile from
      his country. He had turned actor to gain a livelihood; and was going to
      Parma with two actresses, one of whom was interesting. As soon as I found
      out who he was, we became friends, and he would have gladly made me a
      partner in all his amusements, by the way, if I had been in the humour to
      join him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This journey to Leghorn was undertaken under the influence of chimerical
      ideas. I thought I might be useful to Count Orloff, in the conquest he was
      going to make, as it was said, of Constantinople. I fancied that it had
      been decreed by fate that without me he could never pass through the
      Dardanelles. In spite of the wild ideas with which my mind was occupied, I
      conceived a warm friendship for my travelling companion, whose name was
      Angelo Bentivoglio. The Government never forgave him a certain crime,
      which to the philosophic eye appears a mere trifle. In four years later,
      when I describe my stay at Venice, I shall give some further account of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      About noon we reached Parma, and I bade adieu to Bentivoglio and his
      friends. The Court was at Colorno, but having nothing to gain from this
      mockery of a court, and wishing to leave for Bologna the next morning, I
      asked Dubois-Chateleraux, Chief of the Mint, and a talented though vain
      man, to give me some dinner. The reader will remember that I had known him
      twenty two years before, when I was in love with Henriette. He was
      delighted to see me, and seemed to set great store by my politeness in
      giving him the benefit of my short stay at Parma. I told him that Count
      Orloff was waiting for me at Leghorn, and that I was obliged to travel day
      and night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be setting sail before long,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I have advices from
      Leghorn to that effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said in a mysterious tone of voice that he would not sail without me,
      and I could see that my host treated me with increased respect after this.
      He wanted to discuss the Russian Expedition, but my air of reserve made
      him change the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner we talked a good deal about Henriette, whom he said he had
      succeeded in finding out; but though he spoke of her with great respect, I
      took care not to give him any information on the subject. He spent the
      whole afternoon in uttering complaints against the sovereigns of Europe,
      the King of Prussia excepted, as he had made him a baron, though I never
      could make out why.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cursed the Duke of Parma who persisted in retaining his services,
      although there was no mint in existence in the duchy, and his talents were
      consequently wasted there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened to all his complaints, and agreed that Louis XV. had been
      ungrateful in not conferring the Order of St. Michael on him; that Venice
      had rewarded his services very shabbily; that Spain was stingy, and Naples
      devoid of honesty, etc., etc. When he had finished, I asked him if he
      could give me a bill on a banker for fifty sequins.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied in the most friendly manner that he would not give me the
      trouble of going to a banker for such a wretched sum as that; he would be
      delighted to oblige me himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took the money promising to repay him at an early date, but I have never
      been able to do so. I do not know whether he is alive or dead, but if he
      were to attain the age of Methuselah I should not entertain any hopes of
      paying him; for I get poorer every day, and feel that my end is not far
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I was in Bologna, and the day after in Florence, where I met
      the Chevalier Morosini, nephew of the Venetian procurator, a young man of
      nineteen, who was travelling with Count Stratico, professor of mathematics
      at the University of Padua. He gave me a letter for his brother, a Jacobin
      monk, and professor of literature at Pisa, where I stopped for a couple of
      hours on purpose to make the celebrated monk&rsquo;s acquaintance. I found him
      even greater than his fame, and promised to come again to Pisa, and make a
      longer stay for the purpose of enjoying his society.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped an hour at the Wells, where I made the acquaintance of the
      Pretender to the throne of Great Britain, and from there went on to
      Leghorn, where I found Count Orloff still waiting, but only because
      contrary winds kept him from sailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English consul, with whom he was staying, introduced me at once to the
      Russian admiral, who received me with expressions of delight. He told me
      he would be charmed if I would come on board with him. He told me to have
      my luggage taken off at once, as he would set sail with the first fair
      wind. When he was gone the English consul asked me what would be my status
      with the admiral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I mean to find out before embarking my effects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be able to speak to him till to-morrow.&rdquo; Next morning I called
      on Count Orloff, and sent him in a short note, asking him to give me a
      short interview before I embarked my mails.
    </p>
    <p>
      An officer came out to tell me that the admiral was writing in bed, and
      hoped I would wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had been waiting a few minutes, when Da Loglio, the Polish agent at
      Venice and an old friend of mine, came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here, my dear Casanova?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am waiting for an interview with the admiral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this, Da Loglio coolly went into the admiral&rsquo;s room. This was
      impertinent of him; it was as if he said in so many words that the admiral
      was too busy to see me, but not too busy to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment after, Marquis Manucci came in with his order of St. Anne and his
      formal air. He congratulated me on my visit to Leghorn, and then said he
      had read my work on Venice, and had been surprised to find himself in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had some reason for surprise, for there was no connection between him
      and the subject-matter; but he should have discovered before that the
      unexpected often happens. He did not give me time to tell him so, but went
      into the admiral&rsquo;s room as Da Loglio had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was vexed to see how these gentlemen were admitted while I danced
      attendance, and the project of sailing with Orloff began to displease me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In five hours Orloff came out followed by a numerous train. He told me
      pleasantly that we could have our talk at table or after dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After dinner, if you please,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came in and sat down at two o&rsquo;clock, and I was among the guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orloff kept on saying, &ldquo;Eat away, gentlemen, eat away;&rdquo; and read his
      correspondence and gave his secretary letters all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner he suddenly glanced up at me, and taking me by the hand led
      me to the window, and told me to make haste with my luggage, as he should
      sail before the morning if the wind kept up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so; but kindly tell me, count, what is to be my status or
      employment an board your ship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present I have no special employ to give you; that will come in time.
      Come on board as my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The offer is an honourable one so far as you are concerned, but all the
      other officers might treat me with contempt. I should be regarded as a
      kind of fool, and I should probably kill the first man who dared to insult
      me. Give me a distinct office, and let me wear your uniform; I will be
      useful to you. I know the country for which you are bound, I can speak the
      language, and I am not wanting in courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, I really have no particular office to give you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, count, I wish you a pleasant sail; I am going to Rome. I hope you
      may never repent of not taking me, for without me you will never pass the
      Dardanelles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that a prophecy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an oracle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will test its veracity, my dear Calchus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was the short dialogue I had with the worthy count, who, as a matter
      of fact, did not pass the Dardanelles. Whether he would have succeeded if
      I had been on board is more than I can say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day I delivered my letters to M. Rivarola and the English banker. The
      squadron had sailed in the early morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after I went to Pisa, and spent a pleasant week in the company of
      Father Stratico, who was made a bishop two or three years after by means
      of a bold stroke that might have ruined him. He delivered a funeral
      oration over Father Ricci, the last general of the Jesuits. The Pope,
      Ganganelli, had the choice of punishing the writer and increasing the
      odium of many of the faithful, or of rewarding him handsomely. The
      sovereign pontiff followed the latter course. I saw the bishop some years
      later, and he told me in confidence that he had only written the oration
      because he felt certain, from his knowledge of the human heart, that his
      punishment would be a great reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      This clever monk initiated me into all the charms of Pisan society. He had
      organized a little choir of ladies of rank, remarkable for their
      intelligence and beauty, and had taught them to sing extempore to the
      guitar. He had had them instructed by the famous Corilla, who was crowned
      poetess-laureate at the capitol by night, six years later. She was crowned
      where our great Italian poets were crowned; and though her merit was no
      doubt great, it was, nevertheless, more tinsel than gold, and not of that
      order to place her on a par with Petrarch or Tasso.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was satirised most bitterly after she had received the bays; and the
      satirists were even more in the wrong than the profaners of the capitol,
      for all the pamphlets against her laid stress on the circumstance that
      chastity, at all events, was not one of her merits. All poetesses, from
      the days of Homer to our own, have sacrificed on the altar of Venus. No
      one would have heard of Gorilla if she had not had the sense to choose her
      lovers from the ranks of literary men; and she would never have been
      crowned at Rome if she had not succeeded in gaining over Prince Gonzaga
      Solferino, who married the pretty Mdlle. Rangoni, daughter of the Roman
      consul, whom I knew at Marseilles, and of whom I have already spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      This coronation of Gorilla is a blot on the pontificate of the present
      Pope, for henceforth no man of genuine merit will accept the honour which
      was once so carefully guarded by the giants of human intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after the coronation Gorilla and her admirers left Rome, ashamed
      of what they had done. The Abbe Pizzi, who had been the chief promoter of
      her apotheosis, was so inundated with pamphlets and satires that for some
      months he dared not shew his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a long digression, and I will now return to Father Stratico, who
      made the time pass so pleasantly for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he was not a handsome man, he possessed the art of persuasion to
      perfection; and he succeeded in inducing me to go to Sienna, where he said
      I should enjoy myself. He gave me a letter of introduction for the
      Marchioness Chigi, and also one for the Abbe Chiaccheri; and as I had
      nothing better to do I went to Sienna by the shortest way, not caring to
      visit Florence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe Chiaccheri gave me a warm welcome, and promised to do all he
      could to amuse me; and he kept his word. He introduced me himself to the
      Marchioness Chigi, who took me by storm as soon as she had read the letter
      of the Abbe Stratico, her dear abbe, as she called him, when she read the
      superscription in his writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness was still handsome, though her beauty had begun to wane;
      but with her the sweetness, the grace, and the ease of manner supplied the
      lack of youth. She knew how to make a compliment of the slightest
      expression, and was totally devoid of any affection of superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;So you are going to stay a week, I see, from the
      dear abbe&rsquo;s letter. That&rsquo;s a short time for us, but perhaps it may be too
      long for you. I hope the abbe has not painted us in too rosy colours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He only told me that I was to spend a week here, and that I should find
      with you all the charms of intellect and sensibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stratico should have condemned you to a month without mercy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why mercy? What hazard do I run?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of being tired to death, or of leaving some small morsel of your heart at
      Sienna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that might happen in a week, but I am ready to dare the danger, for
      Stratico has guarded me from the first by counting on you, and from the
      second by counting on myself. You will receive my pure and intelligent
      homage. My heart will go forth from Sienna as free as it came, for I have
      no hope of victory, and defeat would make me wretched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible that you are amongst the despairing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and to that fact I owe my happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a pity for you if you found yourself mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not such a pity as you may think, Madam. &lsquo;Carpe diem&rsquo; is my motto. &lsquo;Tis
      likewise the motto of that finished voluptuary, Horace, but I only take it
      because it suits me. The pleasure which follows desires is the best, for
      it is the most acute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, but it cannot be calculated on, and defies the philosopher. May God
      preserve you, madam, from finding out this painful truth by experience!
      The highest good lies in enjoyment; desire too often remains unsatisfied.
      If you have not yet found out the truth of Horace&rsquo;s maxim, I congratulate
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The amiable marchioness smiled pleasantly and gave no positive answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chiaccheri now opened his mouth for the first time, and said that the
      greatest happiness he could wish us was that we should never agree. The
      marchioness assented, rewarding Chiaccheri with a smile, but I could not
      do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had rather contradict you,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;than renounce all hopes of
      pleasing you. The abbe has thrown the apple of discord between us, but if
      we continue as we have begun I shall take up my abode at Sienna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness was satisfied with the sample of her wit which she had
      given me, and began to talk commonplaces, asking me if I should like to
      see company and enjoy society of the fair sex. She promised to take me
      everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do not take the trouble,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I want to leave Sienna with
      the feeling that you are the only lady to whom I have done homage, and
      that the Abbe Chiaccheri has been my only guide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness was flattered, and asked the abbe and myself to dine with
      her on the following day in a delightful house she had at a hundred paces
      from the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The older I grew the more I became attached to the intellectual charms of
      women. With the sensualist, the contrary takes place; he becomes more
      material in his old age: requires women well taught in Venus&rsquo;s shrines,
      and flies from all mention of philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was leaving her I told the abbe that if I stayed at Sienna I would
      see no other woman but her, come what might, and he agreed that I was very
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abbe shewed me all the objects of interest in Sienna, and introduced
      me to the literati, who in their turn visited me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same day Chiaccheri took me to a house where the learned society
      assembled. It was the residence of two sisters&mdash;the elder extremely
      ugly and the younger very pretty, but the elder sister was accounted, and
      very rightly, the Corinna of the place. She asked me to give her a
      specimen of my skill, promising to return the compliment. I recited the
      first thing that came into my head, and she replied with a few lines of
      exquisite beauty. I complimented her, but Chiaccheri (who had been her
      master) guessed that I did not believe her to be the author, and proposed
      that we should try bouts rimes. The pretty sister gave out the rhymes, and
      we all set to work. The ugly sister finished first, and when the verses
      came to be read, hers were pronounced the best. I was amazed, and made an
      improvisation on her skill, which I gave her in writing. In five minutes
      she returned it to me; the rhymes were the same, but the turn of the
      thought was much more elegant. I was still more surprised, and took the
      liberty of asking her name, and found her to be the famous &ldquo;Shepherdess,&rdquo;
       Maria Fortuna, of the Academy of Arcadians.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had read the beautiful stanzas she had written in praise of Metastasio.
      I told her so, and she brought me the poet&rsquo;s reply in manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of admiration, I addressed myself to her alone, and all her plainness
      vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had had an agreeable conversation with the marchioness in the morning,
      but in the evening I was literally in an ecstacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I kept on talking of Fortuna, and asked the abbe if she could improvise in
      the manner of Gorilla. He replied that she had wished to do so, but that
      he had disallowed it, and he easily convinced me that this improvisation
      would have been the ruin of her fine talent. I also agreed with him when
      he said that he had warned her against making impromptus too frequently,
      as such hasty verses are apt to sacrifice wit to rhyme.
    </p>
    <p>
      The honour in which improvisation was held amongst the Greeks and Romans
      is due to the fact that Greek and Latin verse is not under the dominion of
      rhyme. But as it was, the great poets seldom improvised; knowing as they
      did that such verses were usually feeble and common-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace often passed a whole night searching for a vigorous and
      elegantly-turned phrase. When he had succeeded, he wrote the words on the
      wall and went to sleep. The lines which cost him nothing are generally
      prosaic; they may easily be picked out in his epistles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amiable and learned Abbe Chiaccheri, confessed to me that he was in
      love with his pupil, despite her ugliness. He added that he had never
      expected it when he began to teach her to make verses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand that,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;&lsquo;sublata lucerna&rsquo;, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said he, with a laugh, &ldquo;I love her for her face, since it is
      inseparable from my idea of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A Tuscan has certainly more poetic riches at his disposal than any other
      Italian, and the Siennese dialect is sweeter and more energetic than that
      of Florence, though the latter claims the title of the classic dialect, on
      account of its purity. This purity, together with its richness and
      copiousness of diction it owes to the academy. From the great richness of
      Italian we can treat a subject with far greater eloquence than a French
      writer; Italian abounds in synonyms, while French is lamentably deficient
      in this respect. Voltaire used to laugh at those who said that the French
      tongue could not be charged with poverty, as it had all that was
      necessary. A man may have necessaries, and yet be poor. The obstinacy of
      the French academy in refusing to adopt foreign words skews more pride
      than wisdom. This exclusiveness cannot last.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for us we take words from all languages and all sources, provided they
      suit the genius of our own language. We love to see our riches increase;
      we even steal from the poor, but to do so is the general characteristic of
      the rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amiable marchioness gave us a delicious dinner in a house designed by
      Palladio. Chiaccheri had warned me to say nothing about the Shepherdess
      Fortuna; but at dinner she told him she was sure he had taken me to her
      house. He had not the face to deny it, and I did not conceal the pleasure
      I had received.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stratico admires Fortuna,&rdquo; said the marchioness, &ldquo;and I confess that her
      writings have great merit, but it&rsquo;s a pity one cannot go to the house,
      except under an incognito.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I asked, in some astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said she to the abbe, &ldquo;you did not tell him whose house it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not think it necessary, her father and mother rarely shew
      themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s of no consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is her father?&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;the hangman, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse, he&rsquo;s the &lsquo;bargello&rsquo;, and you must see that a stranger cannot be
      received into good society here if he goes to such places as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chiaccheri looked rather hurt, and I thought it my duty to say that I
      would not go there again till the eve of my departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw her sister once,&rdquo; said the marchioness; &ldquo;she is really charmingly
      pretty, and it&rsquo;s a great pity that with her beauty and irreproachable
      morality she should be condemned to marry a man of her father&rsquo;s class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I once knew a man named Coltellini,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;he is the son of the
      bargello of Florence, and is poet-in-ordinary to the Empress of Russia. I
      shall try to make a match between him and Fortuna&rsquo;s sister; he is a young
      man of the greatest talents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness thought my idea an excellent one, but soon after I heard
      that Coltellini was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &lsquo;bargello&rsquo; is a cordially-detested person all over Italy, if you
      except Modena, where the weak nobility make much of the &lsquo;bargello&rsquo;, and do
      justice to his excellent table. This is a curious fact, for as a rule
      these bargellos are spies, liars, traitors, cheats, and misanthropes, for
      a man despised hates his despisers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Sienna I was shewn a Count Piccolomini, a learned and agreeable man. He
      had a strange whim, however, of spending six months in the year in the
      strictest seclusion in his own house, never going out and never seeing any
      company; reading and working the whole time. He certainly did his best to
      make up for his hibernation during the other six months in the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness promised she would come to Rome in the course of the
      summer. She had there an intimate friend in Bianconi who had abandoned the
      practice of medicine, and was now the representative of the Court of
      Saxony.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the eve of my departure, the driver who was to take me to Rome came and
      asked me if I would like to take a travelling companion, and save myself
      three sequins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong, for she is very beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she by herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she is with a gentleman on horseback, who wishes to ride all the way
      to Rome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how did the girl come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On horseback, but she is tired out, and cannot bear it any longer. The
      gentleman has offered me four sequins to take her to Rome, and as I am a
      poor man I think you might let me earn the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he will follow the carriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can go as he likes; that can&rsquo;t make much difference to either of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say she is young and pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been told so, but I haven&rsquo;t seen her myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a man is her companion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fine man, but he can speak very little Italian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he sold the lady&rsquo;s horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it was hired. He has only one trunk, which will go behind the
      carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is all very strange. I shall not give any decision before speaking
      to this man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell him to wait on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Directly afterwards, a brisk-looking young fellow, carrying himself well
      enough, and clad in a fancy uniform, came in. He told me the tale I had
      heard from the coachman, and ended by saying that he was sure I would not
      refuse to accommodate his wife in my carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wife, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw he was a Frenchman, and I addressed him in French.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God be praised! You can speak my native tongue. Yes, sir, she is an
      Englishwoman and my wife. I am sure she will be no trouble to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. I don&rsquo;t want to start later than I had arranged. Will she be
      ready at five o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning when I got into my carriage, I found her already there. I
      paid her some slight compliment, and sat down beside her, and we drove
      off.

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Miss Betty&mdash;The Comte de L&rsquo;Etoile&mdash;Sir B * * * M * * *&mdash;
     Reassured
</pre>
    <p>
      This was the fourth adventure I had had of this kind. There is nothing
      particularly out of the common in having a fellow-traveller in one&rsquo;s
      carriage; this time, however, the affair had something decidedly romantic
      about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was forty-five, and my purse contained two hundred sequins. I still
      loved the fair sex, though my ardour had decreased, my experience had
      ripened, and my caution increased. I was more like a heavy father than a
      young lover, and I limited myself to pretensions of the most modest
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young person beside me was pretty and gentle-looking, she was neatly
      though simply dressed in the English fashion, she was fair and small, and
      her budding breast could be seen outlined beneath the fine muslin of her
      dress. She had all the appearances of modesty and noble birth, and
      something of virginal innocence, which inspired one with attachment and
      respect at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you can speak French madam?&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and a little Italian too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate myself on having you for my travelling companion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you should congratulate me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you came to Sienna on horseback.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I will never do such a foolish thing again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think your husband would have been wise to sell his horse and buy a
      carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hired it; it does not belong to him. From Rome we are going to drive
      to Naples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like travelling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much, but with greater comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words the English girl, whose white skin did not look as if it
      could contain a drop of blood, blushed most violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      I guessed something of her secret, and begged pardon; and for more than an
      hour I remain silent, pretending to gaze at the scenery, but in reality
      thinking of her, for she began to inspire me with a lively interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the position of my young companion was more than equivocal, I
      determined to see my way clearly before I took any decisive step; and I
      waited patiently till we got to Bon Couvent, where we expected to dine and
      meet the husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got there at ten o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Italy the carriages never go faster than a walk; a man on foot can
      outstrip them, as they rarely exceed three miles an hour. The tedium of a
      journey under such circumstances is something dreadful, and in the hot
      months one has to stop five or six hours in the middle of the day to avoid
      falling ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      My coachman said he did not want to go beyond St. Quirico, where there was
      an excellent inn, that night, so he proposed waiting at Bon Couvent till
      four o&rsquo;clock. We had therefore six hours wherein to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English girl was astonished at not finding her husband, and looked for
      him in all directions. I noticed her, and asked the landlord what had
      become of him. He informed us that he had breakfasted and baited his
      horse, and had then gone on, leaving word that he would await us at St.
      Quirico and order supper there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it all very strange, but I said nothing. The poor girl begged me
      to excuse her husband&rsquo;s behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has given me a mark of his confidence, madam, and there is nothing to
      be offended at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The landlord asked me if the vetturino paid my expenses, and I answered in
      the negative; and the girl then told him to ask the vetturino if he was
      paying for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man came in, and to convince the lady that providing her with meals
      was not in the contract, he gave her a paper which she handed to me to
      read. It was signed &ldquo;Comte de l&rsquo;Etoile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she was alone with me my young companion begged me only to order
      dinner for myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understood her delicacy, and this made her all the dearer to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you must please look upon me as an old friend. I guess
      you have no money about you, and that you wish to fast from motives of
      delicacy. Your husband shall repay me, if he will have it so. If I told
      the landlord to only prepare dinner for myself I should be dishonouring
      the count, yourself possibly, and myself most of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel you are right sir. Let dinner be served for two, then; but I
      cannot eat, for I feel ill, and I hope you will not mind my lying on the
      bed for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do not let me disturb you. This is a pleasant room, and they can lay
      the table in the next. Lie down, and sleep if you can, and I will order
      dinner to be ready by two. I hope you will be feeling better by then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I left her without giving her time to answer, and went to order dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had ceased to believe the Frenchman to be the beautiful Englishwoman&rsquo;s
      husband, and began to think I should have to fight him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case, I felt certain, was one of elopement and seduction; and,
      superstitious as usual, I was sure that my good genius had sent me in the
      nick of time to save her and care for her, and in short to snatch her from
      the hands of her infamous deceiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus I fondled my growing passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed at the absurd title the rascal had given himself, and when the
      thought struck me that he had possibly abandoned her to me altogether, I
      made up my mind that he deserved hanging. Nevertheless, I resolved never
      to leave her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lay down on the bed, and as I built a thousand castles in the air I fell
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady awoke me softly, saying that three o&rsquo;clock had struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment before you bring in the dinner. I will go and see if the
      lady is awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I opened the door gently, and saw she was still asleep, but as I closed
      the door after me the noise awoke her, and she asked if I had dined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not take any dinner, madam, unless you do me the honour to dine
      with me. You have had a five hours&rsquo; rest, and I hope you are better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will sit down with you to dinner, as you wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes me happy, and I will order dinner to be served forthwith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ate little, but what little she did eat was taken with a good
      appetite. She was agreeably surprised to see the beefsteaks and plum
      pudding, which I had ordered for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the landlady came in, she asked her if the cook was an Englishman,
      and when she heard that I had given directions for the preparation of her
      national dishes, she seemed full of gratitude. She cheered up, and
      congratulated me on my appetite, while I encouraged her to drink some
      excellent Montepulciano and Montefiascone. By dessert she was in good
      spirits, while I felt rather excited. She told me, in Italian, that she
      was born in London, and I thought I should have died with joy, in reply to
      my question whether she knew Madame Cornelis, she replied that she had
      known her daughter as they had been at school together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Sophie grown tall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she is quite small, but she is very pretty, and so clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must now be seventeen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. We are of the same age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she said this she blushed and lowered her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. I scarcely like to say it, but Sophie is the very image of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you hesitate to say so? It has been remarked to me before. No
      doubt it is a mere coincidence. How long ago is it since you have seen
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighteen months; she went back to her mother&rsquo;s, to be married as it was
      said, but I don&rsquo;t know to whom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your news interests me deeply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The landlord brought me the bill, and I saw a note of three pains which
      her husband had spent on himself and his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said you would pay,&rdquo; observed the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishwoman blushed. I paid the bill, and we went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was delighted to see her blushing, it proved she was not a party to her
      husband&rsquo;s proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was burning with the desire to know how she had left London and had met
      the Frenchman, and why they were going to Rome; but I did not want to
      trouble her by my questions, and I loved her too well already to give her
      any pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had a three hours&rsquo; drive before us, so I turned the conversation to
      Sophie, with whom she had been at school.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Miss Nancy Steyne there when you left?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader may remember how fond I had been of this young lady, who had
      dined with me, and whom I had covered with kisses, though she was only
      twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      My companion sighed at hearing the name of Nancy, and told me that she had
      left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she pretty when you knew her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was a beauty, but her loveliness was a fatal gift to her. Nancy was a
      close friend of mine, we loved each other tenderly; and perhaps our
      sympathy arose from the similarity of the fate in store for us. Nancy, too
      loving and too simple, is now, perhaps, even more unhappy than myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More unhappy? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible that fate has treated you harshly? Is it possible that you
      can be unhappy with such a letter of commendation as nature has given
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! let us speak of something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her countenance was suffused with emotion. I pitied her in secret, and led
      the conversation back to Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me why you think Nancy is unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ran away with a young man she loved; they despaired of gaining the
      parents&rsquo; consent to the match. Since her flight nothing has been heard of
      her, and you see I have some reason to fear that she is unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. I would willingly give my life if it could be the saving
      of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you know her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my own house. She and Sophie dined with me, and her father came in at
      the end of the meal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I know who you are. How often have I heard Sophie talking of you.
      Nancy loved you as well as her father. I heard that you had gone to
      Russia, and had fought a duel with a general in Poland. Is this true? How
      I wish I could tell dear Sophie all this, but I may not entertain such
      hopes now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard the truth about me; but what should prevent you writing
      what you like to England? I take a lively interest in you, trust in me,
      and I promise you that you shall communicate with whom you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am vastly obliged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words she became silent, and I left her to her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o&rsquo;clock we arrived at St. Quirico, and the so-called Comte de
      l&rsquo;Etoile came out and welcomed his wife in the most loving fashion,
      kissing her before everybody, no doubt with the object of giving people to
      understand that she was his wife, and I her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl responded to all his caresses, looking as if a load had been
      lifted off her breast, and without a word of reproach she went upstairs
      with him, having apparently forgotten my existence. I set that down to
      love, youth, and the forgetfulness natural to that early age.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went upstairs in my turn with my carpet bag, and supper was served
      directly, as we had to start very early the next morning if we wished to
      reach Radicofani before the noonday heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had an excellent supper, as the count had preceded us by six hours, and
      the landlord had had plenty of time to make his preparations. The English
      girl seemed as much in love with de l&rsquo;Etoile as he with her, and I was
      left completely out in the cold. I cannot describe the high spirits, the
      somewhat risky sallies, and the outrageous humours of the young gentleman;
      the girl laughed with all her heart, and I could not help laughing too.
    </p>
    <p>
      I considered that I was present at a kind of comedy, and not a gesture,
      not a word, not a laugh did I allow to escape me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may be merely a rich and feather-brained young officer,&rdquo; I said to
      myself, &ldquo;who treats everything in this farcical manner. He won&rsquo;t be the
      first of the species I have seen. They are amusing, but frivolous, and
      sometimes dangerous, wearing their honour lightly, and too apt to carry it
      at the sword&rsquo;s point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On this hypothesis I was ill pleased with my position. I did not much like
      his manner towards myself; he seemed to be making a dupe of me, and
      behaved all the while as if he were doing me an honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the supposition that the Englishwoman was his wife, his treatment of
      myself was certainly not warranted, and I was not the man to play zero. I
      could not disguise the fact, however, that any onlooker would have
      pronounced me to be playing an inferior part.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two beds in the room where we had our supper. When the
      chambermaid came to put on the sheets, I told her to give me another room.
      The count politely begged me to sleep in the same room with them, and the
      lady remained neutral; but I did not much care for their company, and
      insisted on leaving them alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had my carpet bag taken to my room, wished them a good night and locked
      myself in. My friends had only one small trunk, whence I concluded that
      they had sent on their luggage by another way; but they did not even have
      the trunk brought up to their room. I went to bed tranquilly, feeling much
      less interested about the lady than I had been on the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was roused early in the morning, and made a hasty toilette. I could hear
      my neighbours dressing, so I half opened my door, and wished them good day
      without going into their room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a quarter of an hour I heard the sound of a dispute in the court-yard,
      and on looking out, there were the Frenchman and the vetturino arguing
      hotly. The vetturino held the horse&rsquo;s bridle, and the pretended count did
      his best to snatch it away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I guessed the bone of contention: the Frenchman had no money, and the
      vetturino asked in vain for his due. I knew that I should be drawn into
      the dispute, and was making up my mind to do my duty without mercy, when
      the Count de l&rsquo;Etoile came in and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This blockhead does not understand what I say to him; but as he may have
      right on his side, I must ask you to give him two sequins. I will return
      you the money at Rome. By an odd chance I happen to have no money about
      me, but the fellow might trust me as he has got my trunk. However, he says
      he must be paid, so will you kindly oblige me? You shall hear more of me
      at Rome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for me to reply, the rascal went out and ran down the
      stairs. The vetturino remained in the room. I put my head out of the
      window, and saw him leap on horseback and gallop away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat down on my bed, and turned the scene over in my mind, rubbing my
      hands gently. At last I went off into a mad roar of laughter; it struck me
      as so whimsical and original an adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laugh too,&rdquo; said I to the lady, &ldquo;laugh or I will never get up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you that it&rsquo;s laughable enough, but I have not the spirit to
      laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sit down at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave the poor devil of a vetturino two sequins, telling him that I
      should like some coffee and to start in a quarter of an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was grieved to see my companion&rsquo;s sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand your grief,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but you must try to overcome it. I
      have only one favour to ask of you, and if you refuse to grant me that, I
      shall be as sad as you, so we shall be rather a melancholy couple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can tell me on your word of honour whether that extraordinary
      character is your husband, or only your lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you the simple truth; he is not my husband, but we are going
      to be married at Rome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I breathe again. He never shall be your husband, and so much the better
      for you. He has seduced you, and you love him, but you will soon get over
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, unless he deceives me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has deceived you already. I am sure he has told you that he is rich,
      that he is a man of rank, and that he will make you happy; and all that is
      a lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you know all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Experience&mdash;experience is my great teacher. Your lover is a young
      feather-brain, a man of no worth. He might possibly marry you, but it
      would be only to support himself by the sale of your charms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He loves me; I am sure of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he loves you, but not with the love of a man of honour. Without
      knowing my name, or my character, or anything about me, he delivered you
      over to my tender mercies. A man of any delicacy would never abandon his
      loved one thus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not jealous. You know Frenchmen are not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man of honour is the same in France, and England, and Italy, and all
      the world over. If he loved you, would he have left you penniless in this
      fashion? What would you do, if I were inclined to play the brutal lover?
      You may speak freely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should defend myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; then I should abandon you here, and what would you do then?
      You are pretty, you are a woman of sensibility, but many men would take
      but little account of your virtue. Your lover has left you to me; for all
      he knew I might be the vilest wretch; but as it is, cheer up, you have
      nothing to fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you think that adventurer loves you? He is a mere monster. I am
      sorry that what I say makes you weep, but it must be said. I even dare
      tell you that I have taken a great liking to you; but you may feel quite
      sure that I shall not ask you to give me so much as a kiss, and I will
      never abandon you. Before we get to Rome I shall convince you that the
      count, as he calls himself, not only does not love you, but is a common
      swindler as well as a deceiver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will convince me of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, on my word of honour! Dry your eyes, and let us try to make this day
      pass as pleasantly as yesterday. You cannot imagine how glad I feel that
      chance has constituted me your protector. I want you to feel assured of my
      friendship, and if you do not give me a little love in return, I will try
      and bear it patiently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The landlord came in and brought the bill for the count and his mistress
      as well as for myself. I had expected this, and paid it without a word,
      and without looking at the poor wandering sheep beside me. I recollected
      that too strong medicines kill, and do not cure, and I was afraid I had
      said almost too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      I longed to know her history, and felt sure I should hear it before we
      reached Rome. We took some coffee and departed, and not a word passed
      between us till we got to the inn at La Scala, where we got down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road from La Scala to Radicofani is steep and troublesome. The
      vetturino would require an extra horse, and even then would have taken
      four hours. I decided, therefore, to take two post horses, and not to
      begin the journey till ten o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it not be better to go on now?&rdquo; said the English girl; &ldquo;it will be
      very hot from ten till noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but the Comte de l&rsquo;Ltoile, whom we should be sure to meet at
      Radicofani, would not like to see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? I am sure he would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If I had told her my reason she would have wept anew, so in pity I spared
      her. I saw that she was blinded by love, and could not see the true
      character of her lover. It would be impossible to cure her by gentle and
      persuasive argument; I must speak sharply, the wound must be subjected to
      the actual cautery. But was virtue the cause of all this interest? Was it
      devotion to a young and innocent girl that made me willing to undertake so
      difficult and so delicate a task? Doubtless these motives went for
      something, but I will not attempt to strut in borrowed plumes, and must
      freely confess that if she had been ugly and stupid I should probably have
      left her to her fate. In short, selfishness was at the bottom of it all,
      so let us say no more about virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      My true aim was to snatch this delicate morsel from another&rsquo;s hand that I
      might enjoy it myself. I did not confess as much to myself, for I could
      never bear to calmly view my own failings, but afterwards I came to the
      conclusion that I acted a part throughout. Is selfishness, then, the
      universal motor of our actions? I am afraid it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made Betty (such was her name) take a country walk with me, and the
      scenery there is so beautiful that no poet nor painter could imagine a
      more delicious prospect. Betty spoke Tuscan with English idioms and an
      English accent, but her voice was so silvery and clear that her Italian
      was delightful to listen to. I longed to kiss her lips as they spoke so
      sweetly, but I respected her and restrained myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were walking along engaged in agreeable converse, when all at once we
      heard the church bells peal out. Betty said she had never seen a Catholic
      service, and I was glad to give her that pleasure. It was the feast day of
      some local saint, and Betty assisted at high mass with all propriety,
      imitating the gestures of the people, so that no one would have taken her
      for a Protestant. After it was over, she said she thought the Catholic
      rite was much more adapted to the needs of loving souls than the
      Anglican. She was astonished at the southern beauty of the village girls,
      whom she pronounced to be much handsomer that the country lasses in
      England. She asked me the time, and I replied without thinking that I
      wondered she had not got a watch. She blushed and said the count had asked
      her to give it him to leave in pawn for the horse he hired.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sorry for what I had said, for I had put Betty, who was incapable of
      a lie, to great pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      We started at ten o&rsquo;clock with three horses, and as a cool wind was
      blowing we had a pleasant drive, arriving at Radicofani at noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord, who was also the postmaster, asked if I would pay three
      paoli which the Frenchman had expended for his horse and himself, assuring
      the landlord that his friend would pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Betty&rsquo;s sake I said I would pay; but this was not all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman,&rdquo; added the man, &ldquo;has beaten three of my postillions with
      his naked sword. One of them was wounded in the face, and he has followed
      his assailant, and will make him pay dearly for it. The reason of the
      assault was that they wanted to detain him till he had paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were wrong to allow violence to be used; he does not look like a
      thief, and you might have taken it for granted that I should pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken; I was not obliged to take anything of the sort for
      granted; I have been cheated in this sort many times before. Your dinner
      is ready if you want any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Betty was in despair. She observed a distressed silence; and I tried
      to raise her spirits, and to make her eat a good dinner, and to taste the
      excellent Muscat, of which the host had provided an enormous flask.
    </p>
    <p>
      All my efforts were in vain, so I called the vetturino to tell him that I
      wanted to start directly after dinner. This order acted on Betty like
      magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to go as far as Centino, I suppose,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;We had
      better wait there till the heat is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we must push on, as the lady&rsquo;s husband may be in need of help. The
      wounded postillion has followed him; and as he speaks Italian very
      imperfectly, there&rsquo;s no knowing what may happen to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; we will go off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty looked at me with the utmost gratitude; and by way of proving it,
      she pretended to have a good appetite. She had noticed that this was a
      certain way of pleasing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we were at dinner I ordered up one of the beaten postillions, and
      heard his story. He was a frank rogue; he said he had received some blows
      with the flat of the sword, but he boasted of having sent a stone after
      the Frenchman which must have made an impression on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave him a paolo, and promised to make it a crown if he would go to
      Centino to bear witness against his comrade, and he immediately began to
      speak up for the count, much to Betty&rsquo;s amusement. He said the man&rsquo;s wound
      in the face was a mere scratch, and that he had brought it on himself, as
      he had no business to oppose a traveller as he had done. By way of comfort
      he told us that the Frenchman had only been hit by two or three stones.
      Betty did not find this very consoling, but I saw that the affair was more
      comic than tragic, and would end in nothing. The postillion went off, and
      we followed him in half an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty was tranquil enough till we got there, and heard that the count had
      gone on to Acquapendente with the two postillions at his heels; she seemed
      quite vexed. I told her that all would be well; that the count knew how to
      defend himself; but she only answered me with a deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suspected that she was afraid we should have to pass the night together,
      and that I would demand some payment for all the trouble I had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like us to go on to Acquapendente?&rdquo; I asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this question her face beamed all over; she opened her arms, and I
      embraced her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I called the vetturino, and told him I wanted to go on to Acquapendente
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow replied that his horses were in the stable, and that he was not
      going to put them in; but that I could have post horses if I liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Get me two horses immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is my belief that, if I had liked, Betty would have given me everything
      at that moment, for she let herself fall into my arms. I pressed her
      tenderly and kissed her, and that was all. She seemed grateful for my
      self-restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses were put in, and after I had paid the landlord for the supper,
      which he swore he had prepared for us, we started.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reached Acquapendente in three quarters of an hour, and we found the
      madcap count in high spirits. He embraced his Dulcinea with transports,
      and Betty seemed delighted to find him safe and sound. He told us
      triumphantly that he had beaten the rascally postillions, and had warded
      their stones off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the slashed postillion?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is drinking to my health with his comrade; they have both begged my
      pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;this gentleman gave him a crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity! You shouldn&rsquo;t have given them anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before supper the Comte de l&rsquo;Etoile shewed us the bruises on his thighs
      and side; the rascal was a fine well-made fellow. However, Betty&rsquo;s adoring
      airs irritated me, though I was consoled at the thought of the earnest I
      had received from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, the impudent fellow told me that he would order us a good supper
      at Viterbo, and that of course I would lend him a sequin to pay for his
      dinner at Montefiascone. So saying, he shewed me in an off-hand way a bill
      of exchange on Rome for three thousand crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not trouble to read it, and gave him the sequin, though I felt sure
      I should never see it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty now treated me quite confidentially, and I felt I might ask her
      almost any questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we were at Montefiascone she said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see my lover is only without money by chance; he has a bill of
      exchange for a large amount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it to be a forgery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are really too cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; I only wish I were mistaken, but I am sure of the contrary.
      Twenty years ago I should have taken it for a good one, but now it&rsquo;s
      another thing, and if the bill is a good one, why did he not negotiate it
      at Sienna, Florence, or Leghorn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be that he had not the time; he was in such a hurry to be gone.
      Ah! if you knew all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only want to know what you like to tell me, but I warn you again that
      what I say is no vague suspicion but hard fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you persist in the idea that he does not love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, he loves you, but in such a fashion as to deserve hatred in return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you not hate a man who loved you only to traffic in your charms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be sorry for you to think that of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like, I will convince you of what I say this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will oblige me; but I must have some positive proof. It would be a
      sore pain to me, but also a true service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when you are convinced, will you cease to love him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; if you prove him to be dishonest, my love will vanish away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken; you will still love him, even when you have had proof
      positive of his wickedness. He has evidently fascinated you in a deadly
      manner, or you would see his character in its true light before this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this may be true; but do you give me your proofs, and leave to me the
      care of shewing that I despise him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will prove my assertions this evening; but tell me how long you have
      known him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a month; but we have only been together for five days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And before that time you never accorded him any favours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a single kiss. He was always under my windows, and I had reason to
      believe that he loved me fondly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! he loves you, who would not? but his love is not that of a man
      of honour, but that of an impudent profligate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can you suspect a man of whom you know nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that I did not know him! I feel sure that not being able to visit
      you, he made you visit him, and then persuaded you to fly with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he did. He wrote me a letter, which I will shew you. He promises to
      marry me at Rome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is to answer for his constancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His love is my surety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you fear pursuit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he take you from a father, a lover, or a brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From a lover, who will not be back at Leghorn for a week or ten days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where has he gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To London on business; I was under the charge of a woman whom he
      trusted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough; I pity you, my poor Betty. Tell me if you love your
      Englishman, and if he is worthy of your love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! I loved him dearly till I saw this Frenchman, who made me
      unfaithful to a man I adored. He will be in despair at not finding me when
      he returns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he rich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very; he is a business man, and is comfortably off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he young?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He is a man of your age, and a thoroughly kind and honest person. He
      was waiting for his consumptive wife to die to marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor man! Have you presented him with a child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I am sure God did not mean me for him, for the count has conquered me
      completely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everyone whom love leads astray says the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you have heard everything, and I am glad I told you, for I am sure
      you are my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be a better friend to you, dear Betty, in the future than in the
      past. You will need my services, and I promise not to abandon you. I love
      you, as I have said; but so long as you continue to love the Frenchman I
      shall only ask you to consider me as your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept your promise, and in return I promise not to hide anything from
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me why you have no luggage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I escaped on horseback, but my trunk, which is full of linen and other
      effects, will be at Rome two days after us. I sent it off the day before
      my escape, and the man who received it was sent by the count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then good-bye to your trunk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you foresee nothing but misfortune!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dear Betty, I only wish my prophecies may not be accomplished.
      Although you escaped on horseback I think you should have brought a cloak
      and a carpet bag with some linen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that is in the small trunk; I shall have it taken into my room
      tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We reached Viterbo at seven o&rsquo;clock, and found the count very cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      In accordance with the plot I had laid against the count, I began by
      shewing myself demonstratively fond of Betty, envying the fortunate lover,
      praising his heroic behaviour in leaving her to me, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silly fellow proceeded to back me up in my extravagant admiration. He
      boasted that jealousy was utterly foreign to his character, and maintained
      that the true lover would accustom himself to see his mistress inspire
      desires in other men.
    </p>
    <p>
      He proceeded to make a long dissertation on this theme, and I let him go
      on, for I was waiting till after supper to come to the conclusive point.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the meal I made him drink, and applauded his freedom from vulgar
      prejudices. At dessert he enlarged on the duty of reciprocity between
      lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;Betty ought to procure me the enjoyment of Fanny, if
      she has reason to think I have taken a fancy to her; and per contra, as I
      adore Betty, if I found that she loved you I should procure her the
      pleasure of sleeping with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty listened to all this nonsense in silent astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess, my dear count,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;that, theoretically speaking, your
      system strikes me as sublime, and calculated to bring about the return of
      the Golden Age; but I am afraid it would prove absurd in practice. No
      doubt you are a man of courage, but I am sure you would never let your
      mistress be enjoyed by another man. Here are twenty-five sequins. I will
      wager that amount that you will not allow me to sleep with your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! You are mistaken in me, I assure you. I&rsquo;ll bet fifty sequins that
      I will remain in the room a calm spectator of your exploits. My dear
      Betty, we must punish this sceptic; go to bed with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are joking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; to bed with you, I shall love you all the more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be crazy, I shall do nothing of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The count took her in his arms, and caressing her in the tenderest manner
      begged her to do him this favour, not so much for the twenty-five Louis,
      as to convince me that he was above vulgar prejudices. His caresses became
      rather free, but Betty repulsed him gently though firmly, saying that she
      would never consent, and that he had already won the bet, which was the
      case; in fine the poor girl besought him to kill her rather than oblige
      her to do a deed which she thought infamous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her words, and the pathetic voice with which they were uttered, should
      have shamed him, but they only put him into a furious rage. He repulsed
      her, calling her the vilest names, and finally telling her that she was a
      hypocrite, and he felt certain she had already granted me all a worthless
      girl could grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty grew pale as death, and furious in my turn, I ran for my sword. I
      should probably have run him through, if the infamous scoundrel had not
      fled into the next room, where he locked himself in.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in despair at seeing Betty&rsquo;s distress, of which I had been the
      innocent cause, and I did my best to soothe her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in an alarming state. Her breath came with difficulty, her eyes
      seemed ready to start out of her head, her lips were bloodless and
      trembling, and her teeth shut tight together. Everyone in the inn was
      asleep. I could not call for help, and all I could do was to dash water in
      her face, and speak soothing words.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she fell asleep, and I remained beside her for more than two
      hours, attentive to her least movements, and hoping that she would awake
      strengthened and refreshed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At day-break I heard l&rsquo;Etoile going off, and I was glad of it. The people
      of the inn knocked at our door, and then Betty awoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready to go, my dear Betty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am much better, but I should so like a cup of tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Italians cannot make tea, so I took what she gave me, and went to
      prepare it myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came back I found her inhaling the fresh morning air at the window.
      She seemed calm, and I hoped I had cured her. She drank a few cups of tea
      (of which beverage the English are very fond), and soon regained her good
      looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard some people in the room where we had supped, and asked me if I
      had taken up the purse which I had placed on the table. I had forgotten it
      completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found my purse and a piece of paper bearing the words, &ldquo;bill of exchange
      for three thousand crowns.&rdquo; The impostor had taken it out of his pocket in
      making his bet, and had forgotten it. It was dated at Bordeaux, drawn on a
      wine merchant at Paris to l&rsquo;Etoile&rsquo;s order. It was payable at sight, and
      was for six months. The whole thing was utterly irregular.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took it to Betty, who told me she knew nothing about bills, and begged
      me to say nothing more about that infamous fellow. She then said, in a
      voice of which I can give no idea,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake do not abandon a poor girl, more worthy of compassion
      than blame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I promised her again to have all a father&rsquo;s care for her, and soon after
      we proceeded on our journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl fell asleep, and I followed her example. We were awoke by
      the vetturino who informed us, greatly to our astonishment, that we were
      at Monterosi. We had slept for six hours, and had done eighteen miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had to stay at Monterosi till four o&rsquo;clock, and we were glad of it, for
      we needed time for reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place I asked about the wretched deceiver, and was told that
      he had made a slight meal, paid for it, and said he was going to spend the
      night at La Storta.
    </p>
    <p>
      We made a good dinner, and Betty plucking up a spirit said we must
      consider the case of her infamous betrayer, but for the last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be a father to me,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;do not advise but command; you may reckon
      on my obedience. I have no need to give you any further particulars, for
      you have guessed all except the horror with which the thought of my
      betrayer now inspires me. If it had not been for you, he would have
      plunged me into an abyss of shame and misery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you reckon on the Englishman forgiving you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we must go back to Leghorn. Are you strong enough to follow this
      counsel? I warn you that if you approve of it, it must be put into
      execution at once. Young, pretty, and virtuous as you are, you need not
      imagine that I shall allow you to go by yourself, or in the company of
      strangers. If you think I love you, and find me worthy of your esteem,
      that is sufficient regard for me. I will live with you like a father, if
      you are not in a position to give me marks of a more ardent affection. Be
      sure I will keep faith with you, for I want to redeem your opinion of men,
      and to shew you that there are men as honourable as your seducer was
      vile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty remained for a quarter of an hour in profound silence, her head
      resting on her elbows, and her eyes fixed on mine. She did not seem either
      angry or astonished, but as far as I could judge was lost in thought. I
      was glad to see her reflective, for thus she would be able to give me a
      decided answer: At last she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not think, my dear friend, that my silence proceeds from
      irresolution. If my mind were not made up already I should despise myself.
      I am wise enough at any rate to appreciate the wisdom of your generous
      counsels. I thank Providence that I have fallen into the hands of such a
      man who will treat me as if I were his daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we will go back to Leghorn, and start immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My only doubt is how to manage my reconciliation with Sir B&mdash;&mdash;
      M&mdash;&mdash;. I have no doubt he will pardon me eventually; but though
      he is tender and good-hearted he is delicate where a point of honour is
      concerned, and subject to sudden fits of violence. This is what I want to
      avoid; for he might possibly kill me, and then I should be the cause of
      his ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must consider it on the way, and tell me any plans you may think of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is an intelligent man, and it would be hopeless to endeavour to dupe
      him by a lie. I must make a full confession in writing without hiding a
      single circumstance; for if he thought he was being duped his fury would
      be terrible. If you will write to him you must not say that you think me
      worthy of forgiveness; you must tell him the facts and leave him to judge
      for himself. He will be convinced of my repentance when he reads the
      letter I shall bedew with my tears, but he must not know of my whereabouts
      till he has promised to forgive me. He is a slave to his word of honour,
      and we shall live together all our days without my ever hearing of this
      slip. I am only sorry that I have behaved so foolishly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not be offended if I ask you whether you have ever given him
      like cause for complaint before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is his history?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lived very unhappily with his first wife; and he was divorced from his
      second wife for sufficient reasons. Two years ago he came to our school
      with Nancy&rsquo;s father, and made my acquaintance. My father died, his
      creditors seized everything, and I had to leave the school, much to
      Nancy&rsquo;s distress and that of the other pupils. At this period Sir B&mdash;&mdash;
      M&mdash;&mdash; took charge of me, and gave me a sum which placed me
      beyond the reach of want for the rest of my days. I was grateful, and
      begged him to take me with him when he told me he was leaving England. He
      was astonished; and, like a man of honour, said he loved me too well to
      flatter himself that we could travel together without his entertaining
      more ardent feelings for me than those of a father. He thought it out of
      the question for me to love him, save as a daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This declaration, as you may imagine, paved the way for a full
      agreement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;However you love me,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I shall be well pleased, and if I can do
      anything for you I shall be all the happier.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He then gave me of his own free will a written promise to marry me on the
      death of his wife. We started on our travels, and till my late unhappy
      connection I never gave him the slightest cause for complaint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dry your eyes, dear Betty, he is sure to forgive you. I have friends at
      Leghorn, and no one shall find out that we have made acquaintance. I will
      put you in good hands, and I shall not leave the town till I hear you are
      back with Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;. If he prove inexorable I
      promise never to abandon you, and to take you back to England if you
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can you spare the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you the truth, my dear Betty. I have nothing particular to do
      at Rome, or anywhere else. London and Rome are alike to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I shew my gratitude to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I summoned the vetturino, and told him we must return to Viterbo. He
      objected, but I convinced him with a couple of piastres, and by agreeing
      to use the post horses and to spare his own animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got to Viterbo by seven o&rsquo;clock, and asked anxiously if no one had
      found a pocket-book which I pretended I had lost. I was told no such thing
      had been found, so I ordered supper with calmness, although bewailing my
      loss. I told Betty that I acted in this sort to obviate any difficulties
      which the vetturino might make about taking us back to Sienna, as he might
      feel it his duty to place her in the hands of her supposed husband. I had
      up the small trunk, and after we had forced the lock Betty took out her
      cloak and the few effects she had in it, and we then inspected the
      adventurer&rsquo;s properties, most likely all he possessed in the world. A few
      tattered shirts, two or three pairs of mended silk stockings, a pair of
      breeches, a hare&rsquo;s foot, a pot of grease, and a score of little
      books-plays or comic operas, and lastly a packet of letters; such were the
      contents of the trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      We proceeded to read the letters, and the first thing we noted was the
      address: &ldquo;To M. L&rsquo;Etoile, Actor, at Marseilles, Bordeaux, Bayonne,
      Montpellier, etc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I pitied Betty. She saw herself the dupe of a vile actor, and her
      indignation and shame were great.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will read it all to-morrow,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;to-day we have something else to
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl seemed to breathe again.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got over our supper hastily, and then Betty begged me to leave her
      alone for a few moments for her to change her linen and go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I will have a bed made up for me in the next
      room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear friend, ought I not to love your society? What would have become
      of me without you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went out for a few minutes, and when I returned and came to her bedside
      to wish her good night, she gave me such a warm embrace that I knew my
      hour was come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reader, you must take the rest for granted. I was happy, and I had reason
      to believe that Betty was happy also.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning, we had just fallen asleep, when the vetturino knocked at
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dressed myself hastily to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it is absolutely necessary for me to recover my
      pocket-book, and I hope to find it at Acquapendente.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir, very good,&rdquo; said the rogue, a true Italian, &ldquo;pay me as if
      I had taken you to Rome, and a sequin a day for the future, and if you
      like, I will take you to England on those terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The vetturino was evidently what is called wide awake. I gave him his
      money, and we made a new agreement. At seven o&rsquo;clock we stopped at
      Montefiascone to write to Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;, she in
      English, and I in French.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty had now an air of satisfaction and assurance which I found charming.
      She said she was full of hope, and seemed highly amused at the thought of
      the figure which the actor would cut when he arrived at Rome by himself.
      She hoped that we should come across the man in charge of her trunk, and
      that we should have no difficulty in getting it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might pursue us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He dare not do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect not, but if he does I will give him a warm welcome. If he does
      not take himself off I will blow out his brains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I began my letter to Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;, Betty
      again warned me to conceal nothing from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even the reward you gave me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! That is a little secret between ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In less than three hours the letters were composed and written. Betty was
      satisfied with my letter; and her own, which she translated for my
      benefit, was a perfect masterpiece of sensibility, which seemed to me
      certain of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought of posting from Sienna, to ensure her being in a place of safety
      before the arrival of her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only thing that troubled me was the bill of exchange left behind by
      l&rsquo;Etoile, for whether it were true or false, I felt bound to deal with it
      in some way, but I could not see how it was to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      We set out again after dinner in spite of the heat, and arrived at
      Acquapendente in the evening and spent the night in the delights of mutual
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was getting up in the morning I saw a carriage in front of the inn,
      just starting for Rome. I imagined that amidst the baggage Betty&rsquo;s trunk
      might be discovered, and I told her to get up, and see if it were there.
      We went down, and Betty recognized the trunk she had confided to her
      seducer.
    </p>
    <p>
      We begged the vetturino to restore it to us, but he was inflexible; and as
      he was in the right we had to submit. The only thing he could do was to
      have an embargo laid on the trunk at Rome, the said embargo to last for a
      month. A notary was called, and our claim properly drawn up. The
      vetturino, who seemed an honest and intelligent fellow, assured us he had
      received nothing else belonging to the Comte de l&rsquo;Etoile, so we were
      assured that the actor was a mere beggar on the lookout for pickings, and
      that the rags in the small trunk were all his possessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this business had been dispatched Betty brightened up amazingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;is arranging everything. My mistake will serve
      as a warning to me for the future, for the lesson has been a severe one,
      and might have been much worse if I had not had the good fortune of
      meeting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;on having cured yourself so quickly of a
      passion that had deprived you of your reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! a woman&rsquo;s reason is a fragile thing. I shudder when I think of the
      monster; but I verily believe that I should not have regained my senses if
      he had not called me a hypocrite, and said that he was certain I had
      already granted you my favours. These infamous words opened my eyes, and
      made me see my shame. I believe I would have helped you to pierce him to
      the heart if the coward had not run away. But I am glad he did run away,
      not for his sake but for ours, for we should have been in an unpleasant
      position if he had been killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right; he escaped my sword because he is destined for the rope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him look to that himself, but I am sure he will never dare to shew
      his face before you or me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We reached Radicofani at ten o&rsquo;clock, and proceeded to write postscripts
      to our letters to Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;. We were sitting at
      the same table, Betty opposite to the door and I close to it, so that
      anyone coming in could not have seen me without turning round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty was dressed with all decency and neatness, but I had taken off my
      coat on account of the suffocating heat. Nevertheless, though I was in
      shirt sleeves, I should not have been ashamed of my attire before the most
      respectable woman in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once I heard a rapid step coming along the passage, and the door
      was dashed open. A furious-looking man came in, and, seeing Betty, cried
      out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! there you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not give him time to turn round and see me, but leapt upon him and
      seized him by the shoulders. If I had not done so he would have shot me
      dead on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I leapt upon him I had involuntarily closed the door, and as he cried,
      &ldquo;Let me go, traitor!&rdquo; Betty fell on her knees before him, exclaiming, &ldquo;No,
      no! he is my preserver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash; was too mad with rage to pay any
      attention to her, and kept on,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go, traitors!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As may be imagined, I did not pay much attention to this request so long
      as the loaded pistol was in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our struggles he at last fell to the ground and I on top of him. The
      landlord and his people had heard the uproar, and were trying to get in;
      but as we had fallen against the door they could not do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty had the presence of mind to snatch the pistol from his hand, and I
      then let him go, calmly observing,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you are labouring under a delusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Betty threw herself on her knees, begging him to calm himself, as I
      was her preserver not her betrayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;preserver&rsquo;?&rdquo; said B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty gave him the letter, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman read the letter through without rising from the ground, and
      as I was certain of its effect I opened the door and told the landlord to
      send his people away, and to get dinner for three, as everything had been
      settled.

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Rome&mdash;The Actor&rsquo;s Punishment&mdash;Lord Baltimore&mdash;Naples&mdash;Sara
     Goudar&mdash;Departure of Betty&mdash;Agatha&mdash;Medina&mdash;Albergoni&mdash;Miss
     Chudleigh&mdash;The Prince of Francavilla&mdash;The Swimmers
</pre>
    <p>
      As I fell over the Englishman I had struck my hand against a nail, and the
      fourth finger of my left hand was bleeding as if a vein had been opened.
      Betty helped me to tie a handkerchief around the wound, while Sir B&mdash;&mdash;
      M&mdash;&mdash; read the letter with great attention. I was much pleased
      with Betty&rsquo;s action, it shewed she was confident, and sure of her lover&rsquo;s
      forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took up my coat and carpet-bag, and went into the next room to change my
      linen, and dress for dinner. Any distress at the termination of my
      intrigue with Betty was amply compensated for by my joy at the happy
      ending of a troublesome affair which might have proved fatal for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dressed myself, and then waited for half an hour, as I heard Betty and
      Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash; speaking in English calmly enough, and
      I did not care to interrupt them. At last the Englishman knocked at my
      door, and came in looking humble and mortified. He said he was sure I had
      not only saved Betty, but had effectually cured her of her folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must forgive my conduct, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for I could not guess that
      the man I found with her was her saviour and not her betrayer. I thank
      Heaven which inspired you with the idea of catching hold of me from
      behind, as I should certainly have killed you the moment I set eyes on
      you, and at this moment I should be the most wretched of men. You must
      forgive me, sir, and become my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I embraced him cordially, telling him that if I had been in his place I
      should have acted in a precisely similar manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      We returned to the room, and found Betty leaning against the bed, and
      weeping bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood continuing to flow from my wound, I sent for a surgeon who said
      that a vein had been opened, and that a proper ligature was necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty still wept, so I told Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash; that in my
      opinion she deserved his forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgiveness?&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you may be sure I have already forgiven her, and
      she well deserves it. Poor Betty repented directly you shewed her the path
      she was treading, and the tears she is shedding now are tears of sorrow at
      her mistake. I am sure she recognizes her folly, and will never be guilty
      of such a slip again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emotion is infectious. Betty wept, Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;
      wept, and I wept to keep them company. At last nature called a truce, and
      by degrees our sobs and tears ceased and we became calmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;, who was evidently a man of the most
      generous character, began to laugh and jest, and his caresses had great
      effect in calming Betty. We made a good dinner, and the choice Muscat put
      us all in the best of spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash; said we had better rest for a day or
      two; he had journeyed fifteen stages in hot haste, and felt in need of
      repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told us that on arriving at Leghorn, and finding no Betty there, he had
      discovered that her trunk had been booked to Rome, and that the officer to
      whom it belonged had hired a horse, leaving a watch as a pledge for it.
      Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash; recognized Betty&rsquo;s watch, and feeling
      certain that she was either on horseback with her seducer or in the wagon
      with her trunk, he immediately resolved to pursue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I provided myself,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;with two good pistols, not with the idea
      of using one against her, for my first thought about her was pity, and my
      second forgiveness; but I determined to blow out the scoundrel&rsquo;s brains,
      and I mean to do it yet. We will start for Rome to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s concluding words filled Betty with
      joy, and I believe she would have pierced her perfidious lover to the
      heart if he had been brought before her at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall find him at Roland&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash; took Betty in his arms, and gazed at
      me with an air of content, as if he would have shewn me the greatness of
      an English heart&mdash;a greatness which more than atones for its
      weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand your purpose,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but you shall not execute your plans
      without me. Let me have the charge of seeing that justice is done you. If
      you will not agree, I shall start for Rome directly, I shall get there
      before you, and shall give the wretched actor warning of your approach. If
      you had killed him before I should have said nothing, but at Rome it is
      different, and you would have reason to repent of having indulged your
      righteous indignation. You don&rsquo;t know Rome and priestly justice. Come,
      give me your hand and your word to do nothing without my consent, or else
      I shall leave you directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash; was a man of my own height but
      somewhat thinner, and five or six years older; the reader will understand
      his character without my describing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My speech must have rather astonished him, but he knew that my disposition
      was benevolent, and he could not help giving me his hand and his pledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dearest,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;leave vengeance to the friend whom Heaven has
      sent us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consent to do so, provided everything is done in concert between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this we parted, and Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;, being in
      need of rest, I went to tell the vetturino that we should start for Rome
      again on the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Rome! Then you have found your pocketbook? It seems to me, my good
      sir, that you would have been wiser not to search for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The worthy man, seeing my hand done up in lint, imagined I had fought a
      duel, and indeed everybody else came to the same conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash; had gone to bed, and I spent the rest
      of the day in the company of Betty, who was overflowing with the
      gratitude. She said we must forget what had passed between us, and be the
      best of friends for the rest of our days, without a thought of any further
      amorous relations. I had not much difficulty in assenting to this
      condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      She burned with the desire for vengeance on the scoundrelly actor who had
      deceived her; but I pointed out that her duty was to moderate Sir B&mdash;&mdash;
      M&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s passions, as if he attempted any violence in Rome it
      might prove a very serious matter for him, besides its being to the
      disadvantage of his reputation to have the affair talked of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;to have the rogue imprisoned as soon as we
      reach Rome, and that ought to be sufficient vengeance for you. Instead of
      the advantages he proposed for himself, he will receive only shame and all
      the misery of a prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash; slept seven or eight hours, and rose
      to find that a good deal of his rage had evaporated. He consented to abide
      by my arrangements, if he could have the pleasure of paying the fellow a
      visit, as he wanted to know him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this sensible decision and a good supper I went to my lonely couch
      without any regret, for I was happy in the consciousness of having done a
      good action.
    </p>
    <p>
      We started at day-break the next morning, and when we reached
      Acquapendente we resolved to post to Rome. By the post the journey took
      twelve hours, otherwise we should have been three days on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as we reached Rome I went to the customhouse and put in the
      document relating to Betty&rsquo;s trunk. The next day it was duly brought to
      our inn and handed over to Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash; had placed the case in my hands I
      went to the bargello, an important person at Rome, and an expeditious
      officer when he sees a case clearly and feels sure that the plaintiffs do
      not mind spending their money. The bargello is rich, and lives well; he
      has an almost free access to the cardinal-vicar, the governor, and even
      the Holy Father himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave me a private interview directly, and I told him the whole story,
      finally saying that all we asked for was that the rogue should be
      imprisoned and afterwards expelled from Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;that our demand is a very moderate one, and we could
      get all we want by the ordinary channels of the law; but we are in a
      hurry, and I want you to take charge of the whole affair. If you care to
      do so we shall be prepared to defray legal expenses to the extent of fifty
      crowns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bargello asked me to give him the bill of exchange and all the effects
      of the adventurer, including the letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the bill in my pocket and gave it him on the spot, taking a receipt
      in exchange. I told him to send to the inn for the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as I have made him confess the facts you allege against him,&rdquo;
       said the bargello, &ldquo;we shall be able to do something. I have already heard
      that he is at Roland&rsquo;s, and has been trying to get the Englishwoman&rsquo;s
      trunk. If you liked to spend a hundred crowns instead of fifty we could
      send him to the galleys for a couple of years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will see about that,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for the present we will have him into
      prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was delighted to hear that the horse was not l&rsquo;Etoile&rsquo;s property, and
      said that if I liked to call at nine o&rsquo;clock he would have further news
      for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said I would come. I really had a good deal to do at Rome. I wanted to
      see Cardinal Bernis in the first place, but I postponed everything to the
      affair of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went back to the inn and was told by a valet de place, whom Sir B&mdash;&mdash;
      M&mdash;&mdash; had hired, that the Englishman had gone to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were in need of a carriage, so I summoned the landlord and was
      astonished to find myself confronted by Roland in person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I thought you were still at the Place d&rsquo;Espagne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have given my old house to my daughter who has married a prosperous
      Frenchman, while I have taken this palace where there are some magnificent
      rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has your daughter many foreigners staying at her house now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one Frenchman, the Comte de l&rsquo;Etoile, who is waiting for his
      equipage to come on. He has an excellent horse, and I am thinking of
      buying it from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I advise you to wait till to-morrow, and to say nothing about the advice
      I have given you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I wait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say any more just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This Roland was the father of the Therese whom I had loved nine years
      before, and whom my brother Jean had married in 1762, a year after my
      departure. Roland told me that my brother was in Rome with Prince
      Beloselski, the Russian ambassador to the Court of Saxony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood that my brother could not come to Rome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came with a safe-conduct which the Dowager Electress of Saxony
      obtained for him from the Holy Father. He wants his case to be re-tried,
      and there he makes a mistake, for if it were heard a hundred times the
      sentence would continue the same. No one will see him, everyone avoids
      him, even Mengs will have nothing to say to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mengs is here, is he? I though he had been at Madrid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has got leave of absence for a year, but his family remains in Spain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After hearing all this news which was far from pleasant to me, as I did
      not wish to see Mengs or my brother, I went to bed, leaving orders that I
      was to be roused in time for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an hour&rsquo;s time I was awakened by the tidings that some one was waiting
      to give me a note. It was one of the bargello&rsquo;s men, who had come to take
      over l&rsquo;Etoile&rsquo;s effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner I told Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash; what I had done, and
      we agreed that he should accompany me to the bargello&rsquo;s in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon we visited some of the principal palaces, and after
      taking Betty back to the inn we went to the bargello, who told us our man
      was already in prison, and that it would cost very little to send him to
      the galleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before making up my mind I should like to speak to him,&rdquo; said Sir B&mdash;&mdash;
      M&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do so to-morrow. He confessed everything without any trouble, and
      made a jest of it, saying he was not afraid of any consequences, as the
      young lady had gone with him of her own free will. I shewed him the bill
      of exchange, but he evinced no emotion whatever. He told me that he was an
      actor by profession, but also a man of rank. As to the horse, he said he
      was at perfect liberty to sell it, as the watch he had left in pledge was
      worth more than the beast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had forgotten to inform the bargello that the watch aforesaid belonged
      to Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      We gave the worthy official fifty crowns, and supped with Betty, who had,
      as I have remarked, recovered her trunk, and had been busying herself in
      putting her things to rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was glad to hear that the rascal was in prison, but she did not seem
      to wish to pay him a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went to see him in the afternoon of the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bargello had assigned us an advocate, who made out a document
      demanding payment by the prisoner of the expenses of the journey, and of
      his arrest, together with a certain sum as compensation to the person whom
      he had deceived, unless he could prove his right to the title of count in
      the course of six weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found l&rsquo;Etoile with this document in his hand; someone was translating
      it for him into French.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the rascal saw me, he said, with a laugh, that I owed him
      twenty-five Louis as he had left Betty to sleep with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman told him he lied; it was he that had slept with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you Betty&rsquo;s lover?&rdquo; asked l&rsquo;Etoile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and if I had caught you with her I should have blown out your
      brains, for you have deceived her doubly; you&rsquo;re only a beggarly actor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have three thousand crowns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will pay six thousand if the bill proves to be a good one. In the
      meanwhile you will stay here, and if it be false, as I expect it is, you
      will go to the galleys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall speak to my counsel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We went out and called on the advocate, for Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;
      had a lively desire to send the impudent rascal to the galleys. However,
      it could not be done, for l&rsquo;Etoile said he was quite ready to give up the
      bill, but that he expected Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash; to pay a
      crown a day for his keep while he remained in prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash; thought he would like to see something
      of Rome, as he was there, and was obliged to buy almost everything as he
      had left his belongings behind him, while Betty was well provided for as
      her trunk was of immense capacity. I went with them everywhere; it was not
      exactly the life I liked, but there would be time for me to please myself
      after they had gone. I loved Betty without desiring her, and I had taken a
      liking to the Englishman who had an excellent heart. At first he wanted to
      stay a fortnight at Rome, and then to return to Leghorn; but his friend
      Lord Baltimore, who had come to Rome in the meanwhile, persuaded him to
      pay a short visit to Naples.
    </p>
    <p>
      This nobleman, who had with him a very pretty Frenchwoman and two
      servants, said he would see to the journey, and that I must join the
      party. I had made his acquaintance at London.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was glad to have the opportunity of seeing Naples again. We lodged at
      the &ldquo;Crocielles&rdquo; at Chiaggia, or Chiaja, as the Neapolitans call it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first news I heard was the death of the Duke of Matalone and the
      marriage of his widow with Prince Caramanica.
    </p>
    <p>
      This circumstance put an end to some of my hopes, and I only thought of
      amusing myself with my friends, as if I had never been at Naples before.
      Lord Baltimore had been there several times, but his mistress, Betty, and
      Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;, were strangers, and wanted to see
      everything. I accordingly acted as cicerone, for which part I and my lord,
      too, were much better qualified than the tedious and ignorant fellows who
      had an official right to that title.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after our arrival I was unpleasantly surprised to see the
      notorious Chevalier Goudar, whom I had known at London. He called on Lord
      Baltimore.
    </p>
    <p>
      This famous rout had a house at Pausilippo, and his wife was none other
      than the pretty Irish girl Sara, formerly a drawer in a London tavern. The
      reader has been already introduced to her. Goudar knew I had met her, so
      he told me who she was, inviting us all to dine with him the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara shewed no surprise nor confusion at the sight of me, but I was
      petrified. She was dressed with the utmost elegance, received company
      admirably, spoke Italian with perfect correctness, talked sensibly, and
      was exquisitely beautiful; I was stupefied; the metamorphosis was so
      great.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a quarter of an hour five or six ladies of the highest rank arrived,
      with ten or twelve dukes, princes, and marquises, to say nothing of a host
      of distinguished strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table was laid for thirty, but before dinner Madame Goudar seated
      herself at the piano, and sang a few airs with the voice of a siren, and
      with a confidence that did not astonish the other guests as they knew her,
      but which astonished me extremely, for her singing was really admirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goudar had worked this miracle. He had been educating her to be his wife
      for six or seven years.
    </p>
    <p>
      After marrying her he had taken her to Paris, Vienna, Venice, Florence,
      Rome, etc., everywhere seeking fortune, but in vain. Finally he had come
      to Naples, where he had brought his wife into the fashion of obliging her
      to renounce in public the errors of the Anglican heresy. She had been
      received into the Catholic Church under the auspices of the Queen of
      Naples. The amusing part in all this was that Sara, being an Irishwoman,
      had been born a Catholic, and had never ceased to be one.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the nobility, even to the Court, went to see Sara, while she went
      nowhere, for no one invited her. This kind of thing is a characteristic of
      nobility all the world over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goudar told me all these particulars, and confessed that he only made his
      living by gaming. Faro and biribi were the only pillars of his house; but
      they must have been strong ones, for he lived in great style.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked me to join with him, and I did not care to refuse; my purse was
      fast approaching total depletion, and if it were not for this resource I
      could not continue living in the style to which I had been accustomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having taken this resolution I declined returning to Rome with Betty and
      Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;, who wanted to repay me all I had
      spent on her account. I was not in a position to be ostentatious, so I
      accepted his generous offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months later I heard that l&rsquo;Etoile had been liberated by the influence
      of Cardinal Bernis, and had left Rome. Next year I heard at Florence that
      Sir B&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash; had returned to England, where no
      doubt he married Betty as soon as he became a widower.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the famous Lord Baltimore he left Naples a few days after my
      friends, and travelled about Italy in his usual way. Three years later he
      paid for his British bravado with his life. He committed the wild
      imprudence of traversing the Maremma in August, and was killed by the
      poisonous exhalations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped at &ldquo;Crocielles,&rdquo; as all the rich foreigners came to live there.
      I was thus enabled to make their acquaintance, and put them in the way of
      losing their money at Goudar&rsquo;s. I did not like my task, but circumstances
      were too strong for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five or six days after Betty had left I chanced to meet the Abby Gama, who
      had aged a good deal, but was still as gay and active as ever. After we
      had told each other our adventures he informed me that, as all the
      differences between the Holy See and the Court of Naples had been
      adjusted, he was going back to Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he went, however, he said he should like to present me to a lady
      whom he was sure I should be very glad to see again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first persons I thought of were Donna Leonilda, or Donna Lucrezia, her
      mother; but what was my surprise to see Agatha, the dancer with whom I had
      been in love at Turin after abandoning the Corticelli.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our delight was mutual, and we proceeded to tell each other the incidents
      of our lives since we had parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      My tale only lasted a quarter of an hour, but Agatha&rsquo;s history was a long
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had only danced a year at Naples. An advocate had fallen in love with
      her, and she shewed me four pretty children she had given him. The husband
      came in at supper-time, and as she had often talked to him about me he
      rushed to embrace me as soon as he heard my name. He was an intelligent
      man, like most of the pagletti of Naples. We supped together like old
      friends, and the Abbe Gama going soon after supper I stayed with them till
      midnight, promising to join them at dinner the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Agatha was in the very flower of her beauty, the old fires were
      not rekindled in me. I was ten years older. My coolness pleased me, for I
      should not have liked to trouble the peace of a happy home.
    </p>
    <p>
      After leaving Agatha I proceeded to Goudar&rsquo;s, in whose bank I took a
      strong interest. I found a dozen gamesters round the table, but what was
      my surprise to recognize in the holder of the bank Count Medini.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three or four days before this Medini had been expelled from the house of
      M. de Choiseul, the French ambassador; he had been caught cheating at
      cards. I had also my reason to be incensed against him; and, as the reader
      may remember, we had fought a duel.
    </p>
    <p>
      On glancing at the bank I saw that it was at the last gasp. It ought to
      have held six hundred ounces, and there were scarcely a hundred. I was
      interested to the extent of a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      On examining the face of the punter who had made these ravages I guessed
      the game. It was the first time I had seen the rascal at Goudar&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the deal Goudar told me that this punter was a rich
      Frenchman who had been introduced by Medini. He told me I should not mind
      his winning that evening, as he would be sure to lose it all and a good
      deal more another time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who the punter is,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is not of the slightest
      consequence to me, as I tell you plainly that as long as Medini is the
      banker I will have nothing to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told Medini about it and wanted to take a third away from the
      bank, but he seemed offended and said he would make up any loss to you,
      but that he could not have the bank touched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, but if he does not bring me my money by to-morrow morning
      there will be trouble. Indeed, the responsibility lies with you, for I
      have told you that as long as Medini deals I will have nothing to do with
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you have a claim on me for two hundred ounces, but I hope you
      will be reasonable; it would be rather hard for me to lose two-thirds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Knowing Goudar to be a greater rascal than Medini, I did not believe a
      word he said; and I waited impatiently for the end of the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one o&rsquo;clock it was all over. The lucky punter went off with his pockets
      full of gold, and Medini, affecting high spirits, which were very much out
      of place, swore his victory should cost him dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you kindly give me my two hundred ounces,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for, of course,
      Goudar told you that I was out of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess myself indebted to you for that amount, as you absolutely
      insist, but pray tell me why you refuse to be interested in the bank when
      I am dealing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have no confidence in your luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must see that your words are capable of a very unpleasant
      interpretation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t prevent your interpreting my words as you please, but I have a
      right to my own opinion. I want my two hundred ounces, and I am quite
      willing to leave you any moneys you propose to make out of the conqueror
      of to-night. You must make your arrangements with M. Goudar, and by noon
      to-morrow, you, M. Goudar, will bring me that sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remit you the money till the count gives it me, for I haven&rsquo;t got
      any money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you will have some money by twelve o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning.
      Goodnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I would not listen to any of their swindling arguments, and went home
      without the slightest doubt that they were trying to cheat me. I resolved
      to wash my hands of the whole gang as soon as I had got my money back by
      fair means or foul.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nine the next morning I received a note from Medini, begging me to call
      on him and settle the matter. I replied that he must make his arrangements
      with Goudar, and I begged to be excused calling on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of an hour he paid me a visit, and exerted all his eloquence
      to persuade me to take a bill for two hundred ounces, payable in a week. I
      gave him a sharp refusal, saying that my business was with Goudar and
      Goudar only, and that unless I received the money by noon I should proceed
      to extremities. Medini raised his voice, and told me that my language was
      offensive; and forthwith I took up a pistol and placed it against his
      cheek, ordering him to leave the room. He turned pale, and went away
      without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon I went to Goudar&rsquo;s without my sword, but with two good pistols in
      my pocket. Medini was there, and began by reproaching me with attempting
      to assassinate him in my own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took no notice of this, but told Goudar to give me my two hundred
      ounces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goudar asked Medini to give him the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      There would undoubtedly have been a quarrel, if I had not been prudent
      enough to leave the room, threatening Goudar with ruin if he did not send
      on the money directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as I was leaving the house, the fair Sara put her head out of the
      window, and begged me to come up by the back stairs and speak to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged to be excused, so she said she would come down, and in a moment
      she stood beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in the right about your money,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but just at present my
      husband has not got any; you really must wait two or three days, I will
      guarantee the payment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am really sorry,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;not to be able to oblige such a charming
      woman, but the only thing that will pacify me is my money, and till I have
      had it, you will see me no more in your house, against which I declare
      war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon she drew from her finger a diamond ring, worth at least four
      hundred ounces, and begged me to accept it as a pledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took it, and left her after making my bow. She was doubtless astonished
      at my behaviour, for in her state of deshabille she could not have counted
      on my displaying such firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was very well satisfied with my victory, and went to dine with the
      advocate, Agatha&rsquo;s husband. I told him the story, begging him to find
      someone who would give me two hundred ounces on the ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do it myself,&rdquo; said he; and he gave me an acknowledgment and two
      hundred ounces on the spot. He then wrote in my name a letter to Goudar,
      informing him that he was the depositary of the ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      This done, I recovered my good temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before dinner Agatha took me into her boudoir and shewed me all the
      splendid jewels I had given her when I was rich and in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I am a rich woman,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and my good fortune is all your
      making; so take back what you gave me. Don&rsquo;t be offended; I am so grateful
      to you, and my good husband and I agreed on this plan this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To take away any scruples I might have, she shewed me the diamonds her
      husband had given her; they had belonged to his first wife and were worth
      a considerable sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      My gratitude was too great for words, I could only press her hand, and let
      my eyes speak the feelings of my heart. Just then her husband came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had evidently been concerted between them, for the worthy man embraced
      me, and begged me to accede to his wife&rsquo;s request.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then joined the company which consisted of a dozen or so of their
      friends, but the only person who attracted my attention was a very young
      man, whom I set down at once as in love with Agatha. His name was Don
      Pascal Latilla; and I could well believe that he would be successful in
      love, for he was intelligent, handsome, and well-mannered. We became
      friends in the course of the meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the ladies I was greatly pleased with one young girl. She was only
      fourteen, but she looked eighteen. Agatha told me she was studying
      singing, intending to go on the stage as she was so poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So pretty, and yet poor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for she will have all or nothing; and lovers of that kind are rare
      in Naples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she must have some lover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she has, no one has heard of him. You had better make her acquaintance
      and go and see her. You will soon be friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Callimena. The lady who is speaking to her is her aunt, and I expect they
      are talking about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We sat down to the enjoyment of a delicate and abundant meal. Agatha, I
      could see, was happy, and delighted to shew me how happy she was. The old
      Abbe Gama congratulated himself on having presented me. Don Pascal Latilla
      could not be jealous of the attentions paid me by his idol, for I was a
      stranger, and they were my due; while her husband prided himself on his
      freedom from those vulgar prejudices to which so many Neapolitans are
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of all this gaiety I could not help stealing many a furtive
      glance towards Callimena. I addressed her again and again, and she
      answered me politely but so briefly as to give me no opportunity of
      displaying my powers in the way of persiflage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked if her name was her family name or a pseudonym.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my baptismal name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Greek; but, of course, you know what it means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad beauty, or fair moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to say that I have nothing in common with my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any brothers or sisters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only one married sister, with whom you may possibly be
      acquainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is her name, and who is her husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her husband is a Piedmontese, but she does not live with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she the Madame Slopis who travels with Aston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can give you good news of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After dinner I asked Agatha how she came to know Callimena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband is her godfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is her exact age?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fourteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a simple prodigy! What loveliness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her sister is still handsomer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never seen her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A servant came in and said M. Goudar would like to have a little private
      conversation with the advocate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advocate came back in a quarter of an hour, and informed me that
      Goudar had given him the two hundred ounces, and that he had returned him
      the ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s all settled, and I am very glad of it. I have certainly made
      an eternal enemy of him, but that doesn&rsquo;t trouble me much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We began playing, and Agatha made me play with Callimena, the freshness
      and simplicity of whose character delighted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her all I knew about her sister, and promised I would write to
      Turin to enquire whether she were still there. I told her that I loved
      her, and that if she would allow me, I would come and see her. Her reply
      was extremely satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning I went to wish her good day. She was taking a music
      lesson from her master. Her talents were really of a moderate order, but
      love made me pronounce her performance to be exquisite.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the master had gone, I remained alone with her. The poor girl
      overwhelmed me with apologies for her dress, her wretched furniture, and
      for her inability to give me a proper breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that make you more desirable in my eyes, and I am only sorry that I
      cannot offer you a fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I praised her beauty, she allowed me to kiss her ardently, but she
      stopped my further progress by giving me a kiss as if to satisfy me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made an effort to restrain my ardour, and told her to tell me truly
      whether she had a lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you never had one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even a fancy for anyone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, with your beauty and sensibility, is there no man in Naples who has
      succeeded in inspiring you with desire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one has ever tried to do so. No one has spoken to me as you have, and
      that is the plain truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you, and I see that I must make haste to leave Naples, if I
      would not be the most unhappy of men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should love you without the hope of possessing you, and thus I should
      be most unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love me then, and stay. Try and make me love you. Only you must moderate
      your ecstacies, for I cannot love a man who cannot exercise
      self-restraint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As just now, for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. If you calm yourself I shall think you do so for my sake, and thus
      love will tread close on the heels of gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was as much as to tell me that though she did not love me yet I had
      only to wait patiently, and I resolved to follow her advice. I had reached
      an age which knows nothing of the impatient desires of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave her a tender embrace, and as I was getting up to go I asked her if
      she were in need of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      This question male her blush, and she said I had better ask her aunt, who
      was in the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went in, and was somewhat astonished to find the aunt seated between two
      worthy Capuchins, who were talking small talk to her while she worked at
      her needle. At a little distance three young girls sat sewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aunt would have risen to welcome me, but I prevented her, asked her
      how she did, and smilingly congratulated her on her company. She smiled
      back, but the Capuchins sat as firm as two stocks, without honouring me
      with as much as a glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took a chair and sat down beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was near her fiftieth year, though some might have doubted whether she
      would ever see it again; her manner was good and honest, and her features
      bore the traces of the beauty that time had ruined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although I am not a prejudiced man, the presence of the two evil-smelling
      monks annoyed me extremely. I thought the obstinate way in which they
      stayed little less than an insult. True they were men like myself, in
      spite of their goats&rsquo; beards and dirty frocks, and consequently were
      liable to the same desires as I; but for all that I found them wholly
      intolerable. I could not shame them without shaming the lady, and they
      knew it; monks are adepts at such calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have travelled all over Europe, but France is the only country in which
      I saw a decent and respectable clergy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a quarter of an hour I could contain myself no longer, and
      told the aunt that I wished to say something to her in private. I thought
      the two satyrs would have taken the hint, but I counted without my host.
      The aunt arose, however, and took me into the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked my question as delicately as possible, and she replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! I have only too great a need of twenty ducats (about eighty francs)
      to pay my rent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave her the money on the spot, and I saw that she was very grateful,
      but I left her before she could express her feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I must tell my readers (if I ever have any) of an event which took
      place on that same day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was dining in my room by myself, I was told that a Venetian gentleman
      who said he knew me wished to speak to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ordered him to be shewn in, and though his face was not wholly unknown
      to me I could not recollect who he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was tall, thin and wretched, misery and hunger shewing plainly in his
      every feature; his beard was long, his head shaven, his robe a dingy
      brown, and bound about him with a coarse cord, whence hung a rosary and a
      dirty handkerchief. In the left hand he bore a basket, and in the right a
      long stick; his form is still before me, but I think of him not as a
      humble penitent, but as a being in the last state of desperation; almost
      an assassin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; I said at length. &ldquo;I think I have seen you before, and yet
      . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will soon tell you my name and the story of my woes; but first give me
      something to eat, for I am dying of hunger. I have had nothing but bad
      soup for the last few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; go downstairs and have your dinner, and then come back to me;
      you can&rsquo;t eat and speak at the same time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My man went down to give him his meal, and I gave instructions that I was
      not to be left alone with him as he terrified me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt sure that I ought to know him, and longed to hear his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      In three quarters of an hour he came up again, looking like some one in a
      high fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and speak freely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Albergoni.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albergoni was a gentleman of Padua, and one of my most intimate friends
      twenty-five years before. He was provided with a small fortune, but an
      abundance of wit, and had a great leaning towards pleasure and the
      exercise of satire. He laughed at the police and the cheated husbands,
      indulged in Venus and Bacchus to excess, sacrificed to the god of
      pederasty, and gamed incessantly. He was now hideously ugly, but when I
      knew him first he was a very Antinous.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told me the following story:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A club of young rakes, of whom I was one, had a casino at the Zuecca; we
      passed many a pleasant hour there without hurting anyone. Some one
      imagined that these meetings were the scenes of unlawful pleasures, the
      engines of the law were secretly directed against us, and the casino was
      shut up, and we were ordered to be arrested. All escaped except myself and
      a man named Branzandi. We had to wait for our unjust sentence for two
      years, but at last it appeared. My wretched fellow was condemned to lose
      his head, and afterwards to be burnt, while I was sentenced to ten years&rsquo;
      imprisonment &lsquo;in carcere duro&rsquo;. In 1765 I was set free, and went to Padua
      hoping to live in peace, but my persecutors gave me no rest, and I was
      accused of the same crime. I would not wait for the storm to burst, so I
      fled to Rome, and two years afterwards the Council of Ten condemned me to
      perpetual banishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might bear this if I had the wherewithal to live, but a brother-in-law
      of mine has possessed himself of all I have, and the unjust Tribunal winks
      at his misdeeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Roman attorney made me an offer of an annuity of two paoli a day on the
      condition that I should renounce all claims on my estate. I refused this
      iniquitous condition, and left Rome to come here and turn hermit. I have
      followed this sorry trade for two years, and can bear it no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back to Rome; you can live on two pawls a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I pitied him sincerely, and said that though I was not a rich man he was
      welcome to dine every day at my expense while I remained in Naples, and I
      gave him a sequin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three days later my man told me that the poor wretch had committed
      suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his room were found five numbers, which he bequeathed to Medini and
      myself out of gratitude for our kindness to him. These five numbers were
      very profitable to the Lottery of Naples, for everyone, myself excepted,
      rushed to get them. Not a single one proved a winning number, but the
      popular belief that numbers given by a man before he commits suicide are
      infallible is too deeply rooted among the Neapolitans to be destroyed by
      such a misadventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to see the wretched man&rsquo;s body, and then entered a cafe. Someone
      was talking of the case, and maintaining that death by strangulation must
      be most luxurious as the victim always expires with a strong erection. It
      might be so, but the erection might also be the result of an agony of
      pain, and before anyone can speak dogmatically on the point he must first
      have had a practical experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was leaving the cafe I had the good luck to catch a handkerchief
      thief in the act; it was about the twentieth I had stolen from me in the
      month I had spent at Naples. Such petty thieves abound there, and their
      skill is something amazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he felt himself caught, he begged me not to make any noise,
      swearing he would return all the handkerchiefs he had stolen from me,
      which, as he confessed, amounted to seven or eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have stolen more than twenty from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, but some of my mates. If you come with me, perhaps we shall be
      able to get them all back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it far off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the Largo del Castello. Let me go; people are looking at us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little rascal took me to an evil-looking tavern, and shewed me into a
      room, where a man asked me if I wanted to buy any old things. As soon as
      he heard I had come for my handkerchiefs, he opened a big cupboard full of
      handkerchiefs, amongst which I found a dozen of mine, and bought them back
      for a trifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after I bought several others, though I knew they were stolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy Neapolitan dealer seemed to think me trustworthy, and three or
      four days before I left Naples he told me that he could sell me, for ten
      or twelve thousand ducats, commodities which would fetch four times that
      amount at Rome or elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of commodities are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watches, snuff-boxes, rings, and jewels, which I dare not sell here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid of being discovered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much, I don&rsquo;t tell everyone of my business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him, but I would not look at his trinkets, as I was afraid the
      temptation of making such a profit would be too great.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got back to my inn I found some guests had arrived, of whom a few
      were known to me. Bartoldi had arrived from Dresden with two young Saxons,
      whose tutor he was. These young noblemen were rich and handsome, and
      looked fond of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartoldi was an old friend of mine. He had played Harlequin at the King of
      Poland&rsquo;s Italian Theatre. On the death of the monarch he had been placed
      at the head of the opera-buffa by the dowager electress, who was
      passionately fond of music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the other strangers were Miss Chudleigh, now Duchess of Kingston,
      with a nobleman and a knight whose names I have forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duchess recognized me at once, and seemed pleased that I paid my court
      to her. An hour afterwards Mr. Hamilton came to see her, and I was
      delighted to make his acquaintance. We all dined together. Mr. Hamilton
      was a genius, and yet he ended by marrying a mere girl, who was clever
      enough to make him in love with her. Such a misfortune often comes to
      clever men in their old age. Marriage is always a folly; but when a man
      marries a young woman at a time of life when his physical strength is
      running low, he is bound to pay dearly for his folly; and if his wife is
      amorous of him she will kill him even years ago I had a narrow escape
      myself from the same fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner I presented the two Saxons to the duchess; they gave her news
      of the dowager electress, of whom she was very fond. We then went to the
      play together. As chance would have it, Madame Goudar occupied the box
      next to ours, and Hamilton amused the duchess by telling the story of the
      handsome Irishwoman, but her grace did not seem desirous of making Sara&rsquo;s
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper the duchess arranged a game of quinze with the two Englishmen
      and the two Saxons. The stakes were small, and the Saxons proved
      victorious. I had not taken any part in the game, but I resolved to do so
      the next evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day we dined magnificently with the Prince of Francavilla,
      and in the afternoon he took us to the bath by the seashore, where we saw
      a wonderful sight. A priest stripped himself naked, leapt into the water,
      and without making the slightest movement floated on the surface like a
      piece of deal. There was no trick in it, and the marvel must be assigned
      to some special quality in his organs of breathing. After this the prince
      amused the duchess still more pleasantly. He made all his pages, lads of
      fifteen to seventeen, go into the water, and their various evolutions
      afforded us great pleasure. They were all the sweethearts of the prince,
      who preferred Ganymede to Hebe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishmen asked him if if he would give us the same spectacle, only
      substituting nymphs for the &lsquo;amoyini&rsquo;, and he promised to do so the next
      day at his splendid house near Portici, where there was a marble basin in
      the midst of the garden.

     My Amours with Gallimena&mdash;Journey to Sorrento&mdash;Medini&mdash;

     Cornelis&rsquo;s Son&mdash;An Anecdote of Sara Goudar&mdash;The Florentines

     and Arrival at Rome
</pre>
    <p>
      The Prince of Francavilla was a rich Epicurean, whose motto was &lsquo;Fovet et
      favet&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in favour in Spain, but the king allowed him to live at Naples, as
      he was afraid of his initiating the Prince of Asturias, his brothers, and
      perhaps the whole Court, into his peculiar vices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day he kept his promise, and we had the pleasure of seeing the
      marble basin filled with ten or twelve beautiful girls who swam about in
      the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Chudleigh and the two other ladies pronounced this spectacle tedious;
      they no doubt preferred that of the previous day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of this gay company I went to see Callimena twice a day; she
      still made me sigh in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agatha was my confidante; she would gladly have helped me to attain my
      ends, but her dignity would not allow of her giving me any overt
      assistance. She promised to ask Callimena to accompany us on an excursion
      to Sorrento, hoping that I should succeed in my object during the night we
      should have to spend there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Agatha had made these arrangements, Hamilton had made similar ones
      with the Duchess of Kingston, and I succeeded in getting an invitation. I
      associated chiefly with the two Saxons and a charming Abbe Guliani, with
      whom I afterwards made a more intimate acquaintance at Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      We left Naples at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, in a felucca with twelve
      oars, and at nine we reached Sorrento.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were fifteen in number, and all were delighted with this earthly
      paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamilton took us to a garden belonging to the Duke of Serra Capriola, who
      chanced to be there with his beautiful Piedmontese wife, who loved her
      husband passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke had been sent there two months before for having appeared in
      public in an equipage which was adjudged too magnificent. The minister
      Tanucci called on the king to punish this infringement of the sumptuary
      laws, and as the king had not yet learnt to resist his ministers, the duke
      and his wife were exiled to this earthly paradise. But a paradise which is
      a prison is no paradise at all; they were both dying of ennui, and our
      arrival was balm in Gilead to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain Abbe Bettoni, whose acquaintance I had made nine years before at
      the late Duke of Matalone&rsquo;s, had come to see them, and was delighted to
      meet me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abbe was a native of Brescia, but he had chosen Sorrento as his
      residence. He had three thousand crowns a year, and lived well, enjoying
      all the gifts of Bacchus, Ceres, Comus, and Venus, the latter being his
      favourite divinity. He had only to desire to attain, and no man could
      desire greater pleasure than he enjoyed at Sorrento. I was vexed to see
      Count Medini with him; we were enemies, and gave each other the coldest of
      greetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were twenty-two at table and enjoyed delicious fare, for in that land
      everything is good; the very bread is sweeter than elsewhere. We spent the
      afternoon in inspecting the villages, which are surrounded by avenues
      finer than the avenues leading to the grandest castles in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe Bettoni treated us to lemon, coffee, and chocolate ices, and some
      delicious cream cheese. Naples excels in these delicacies, and the abbe
      had everything of the best. We were waited on by five or six country girls
      of ravishing beauty, dressed with exquisite neatness. I asked him whether
      that were his seraglio, and he replied that it might be so, but that
      jealousy was unknown, as I should see for myself if I cared to spend a
      week with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I envied this happy man, and yet I pitied him, for he was at least twelve
      years older than I, and I was by no means young. His pleasures could not
      last much longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening we returned to the duke&rsquo;s, and sat down to a supper
      composed of several kinds of fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air of Sorrento gives an untiring appetite, and the supper soon
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper my lady proposed a game at faro, and Bettoni, knowing Medini
      to be a professional gamester, asked him to hold the bank. He begged to be
      excused, saying he had not enough money, so I consented to take his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cards were brought in, and I emptied my poor purse on the table. It
      only held four hundred ounces, but that was all I possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game began; and on Medini asking me if I would allow him a share in
      the bank, I begged him to excuse me on the score of inconvenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went on dealing till midnight, and by that time I had only forty ounces
      left. Everybody had won except Sir Rosebury, who had punted in English
      bank notes, which I had put into my pocket without counting.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got to my room I thought I had better look at the bank notes, for
      the depletion of my purse disquieted me. My delight may be imagined. I
      found I had got four hundred and fifty pounds&mdash;more than double what
      I had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to sleep well pleased with my day&rsquo;s work, and resolved not to tell
      anyone of my good luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duchess had arranged for us to start at nine, and Madame de Serra
      Capriola begged us to take coffee with her before going.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast Medini and Bettoni came in, and the former asked Hamilton
      whether he would mind his returning with us. Of course, Hamilton could not
      refuse, so he came on board, and at two o&rsquo;clock I was back at my inn. I
      was astonished to be greeted in my antechamber by a young lady, who asked
      me sadly whether I remembered her. She was the eldest of the five
      Hanoverians, the same that had fled with the Marquis della Petina.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her to come in, and ordered dinner to be brought up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are alone,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I should be glad to share your repast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; I will order dinner for two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her story was soon told. She had come to Naples with her husband, whom her
      mother refused to recognize. The poor wretch had sold all he possessed,
      and two or three months after he had been arrested on several charges of
      forgery. His poor mate had supported him in prison for seven years. She
      had heard that I was at Naples, and wanted me to help her, not as the
      Marquis della Petina wished, by lending him money, but by employing my
      influence with the Duchess of Kingston to make that lady take her to
      England with her in her service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you married to the marquis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how could you keep him for seven years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas . . . . You can think of a hundred ways, and they would all be
      true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you procure me an interview with the duchess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will try, but I warn you that I shall tell her the simple truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come again to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At six o&rsquo;clock I went to ask Hamilton how I could exchange the English
      notes I had won, and he gave me the money himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before supper I spoke to the duchess about the poor Hanoverian. My lady
      said she remembered seeing her, and that she would like to have a talk
      with her before coming to any decision. I brought the poor creature to her
      the next day, and left them alone. The result of the interview was that
      the duchess took her into her service in the place of a Roman girl, and
      the Hanoverian went to England with her. I never heard of her again, but a
      few days after Petina sent to beg me to come and see him in prison, and I
      could not refuse. I found him with a young man whom I recognized as his
      brother, though he was very handsome and the marquis very ugly; but the
      distinction between beauty and ugliness is often hard to point out.
    </p>
    <p>
      This visit proved a very tedious one, for I had to listen to a long story
      which did not interest me in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was going out I was met by an official, who said another prisoner
      wanted to speak to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name is Gaetano, and he says he is a relation of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My relation and Gaetano! I thought it might be the abbe.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up to the first floor, and found a score of wretched prisoners
      sitting on the ground roaring an obscene song in chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such gaiety is the last resource of men condemned to imprisonment on the
      galleys; it is nature giving her children some relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the prisoners came up to me and greeted me as &ldquo;gossip.&rdquo; He would
      have embraced me, but I stepped back. He told me his name, and I
      recognized in him that Gaetano who had married a pretty woman under my
      auspices as her godfather. The reader may remember that I afterwards
      helped her to escape from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to see you here, but what can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can pay me the hundred crowns you owe me, for the goods supplied to
      you at Paris by me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a lie, so I turned my back on him, saying I supposed imprisonment
      had driven him mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I went away I asked an official why he had been imprisoned, and was
      told it was for forgery, and that he would have been hanged if it had not
      been for a legal flaw. He was sentenced to imprisonment for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dismissed him from my mind, but in the afternoon I had a visit from an
      advocate who demanded a hundred crowns on Gaetano&rsquo;s behalf, supporting his
      claim by the production of an immense ledger, where my name appeared as
      debtor on several pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the man is mad; I don&rsquo;t owe him anything, and the evidence
      of this book is utterly worthless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make a mistake, sir,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;this ledger is good evidence, and
      our laws deal very favorably with imprisoned creditors. I am retained for
      them, and if you do not settle the matter by to-morrow I shall serve you
      with a summons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I restrained my indignation and asked him politely for his name and
      address. He wrote it down directly, feeling quite certain that his affair
      was as good as settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      I called on Agatha, and her husband was much amused when I told my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made me sign a power of attorney, empowering him to act for me, and he
      then advised the other advocate that all communications in the case must
      be made to him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &lsquo;paglietti&rsquo; who abound in Naples only live by cheating, and especially
      by imposing on strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Rosebury remained at Naples, and I found myself acquainted with all
      the English visitors. They all lodged at &ldquo;Crocielles,&rdquo; for the English are
      like a flock of sheep; they follow each other about, always go to the same
      place, and never care to shew any originality. We often arranged little
      trips in which the two Saxons joined, and I found the time pass very
      pleasantly. Nevertheless, I should have left Naples after the fair if my
      love for Callimena had not restrained me. I saw her every day and made her
      presents, but she only granted me the slightest of favours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair was nearly over, and Agatha was making her preparations for going
      to Sorrento as had been arranged. She begged her husband to invite a lady
      whom he had loved before marrying her while she invited Pascal Latilla for
      herself, and Callimena for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were thus three couples, and the three gentlemen were to defray all
      expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agatha&rsquo;s husband took the direction of everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days before the party I saw, to my surprise, Joseph, son of Madame
      Cornelis and brother of my dear Sophie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come to Naples? Whom are you with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am by myself. I wanted to see Italy, and my mother gave me this
      pleasure. I have seen Turin, Milan, Genoa, Florence, Venice, and Rome; and
      after I have done Italy I shall see Switzerland and Germany, and then
      return to England by way of Holland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long is this expedition to take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you will be able to give a full account of everything when you
      go back to London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope to convince my mother that the money she spent was not wasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you think it will cost you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The five hundred guineas she gave me, no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say you are only going to spend five hundred guineas in
      six months? I can&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Economy works wonders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. How have you done as to letters of introduction in all
      these countries of which you now know so much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had no introductions. I carry an English passport, and let people
      think that I am English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid of getting into bad company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give myself the chance. I don&rsquo;t speak to anyone, and when people
      address me I reply in monosyllables. I always strike a bargain before I
      eat a meal or take a lodging. I only travel in public conveyances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Here you will be able to economize; I will pay all your
      expenses, and give you an excellent cicerone, one who will cost you
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am much obliged, but I promised my mother not to accept anything from
      anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you might make an exception in my case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I have relations in Venice, and I would not take so much as a single
      dinner from them. When I promise, I perform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Knowing his obstinacy, I did not insist. He was now a young man of
      twenty-three, of a delicate order of prettiness, and might easily have
      been taken for a girl in disguise if he had not allowed his whiskers to
      grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although his grand tour seemed an extravagant project, I could not help
      admiring his courage and desire to be well informed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him about his mother and daughter, and he replied to my questions
      without reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told me that Madame Cornelis was head over ears in debts, and spent
      about half the year in prison. She would then get out by giving fresh
      bills and making various arrangements with her creditors, who knew that if
      they did not allow her to give her balls, they could not expect to get
      their money.
    </p>
    <p>
      My daughter, I heard, was a pretty girl of seventeen, very talented, and
      patronized by the first ladies in London. She gave concerts, but had to
      bear a good deal from her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him to whom she was to have been married, when she was taken from
      the boarding school. He said he had never heard of anything of the kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in any business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. My mother is always talking of buying a cargo and sending me with it
      to the Indies, but the day never seems to come, and I am afraid it never
      will come. To buy a cargo one must have some money, and my mother has
      none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his promise, I induced him to accept the services of my man,
      who shewed him all the curiosities of Naples in the course of a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not make him stay another week. He set out for Rome, and wrote to
      me from there that he had left six shirts and a great coat behind him. He
      begged me to send them on, but he forgot to give me his address.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a hare-brained fellow, and yet with the help of two or three sound
      maxims he managed to traverse half Europe without coming to any grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had an unexpected visit from Goudar, who knew the kind of company I
      kept, and wanted me to ask his wife and himself to dinner to meet the two
      Saxons and my English friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      I promised to oblige him on the understanding that there was to be no play
      at my house, as I did not want to be involved in any unpleasantness. He
      was perfectly satisfied with this arrangement, as he felt sure his wife
      would attract them to his house, where, as he said, one could play without
      being afraid of anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was going to Sorrento the next day, I made an appointment with him for
      a day after my return.
    </p>
    <p>
      This trip to Sorrento was my last happy day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advocate took us to a house where we were lodged with all possible
      comfort. We had four rooms; the first was occupied by Agatha and her
      husband, the second by Callimena and the advocate&rsquo;s old sweetheart, the
      third by Pascal Latilla, and the fourth by myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper we went early to bed, and rising with the sun we went our
      several ways; the advocate with his old sweetheart, Agatha with Pascal,
      and I with Callimena. At noon we met again to enjoy a delicious dinner,
      and then the advocate took his siesta, while Pascal went for a walk with
      Agatha and her husband&rsquo;s sweetheart, and I wandered with Callimena under
      the shady alleys where the heat of the sun could not penetrate. Here it
      was that Callimena consented to gratify my passion. She gave herself for
      love&rsquo;s sake alone, and seemed sorry she had made me wait so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fourth day we returned to Naples in three carriages, as there was a
      strong wind. Callimena persuaded me to tell her aunt what had passed
      between us, that we might be able to meet without any restraint for the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      I approved of her idea, and, not fearing to meet with much severity from
      the aunt, I took her apart and told her all that had passed, making her
      reasonable offers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a sensible woman, and heard what I had to say with great good
      humour. She said that as I seemed inclined to do something for her niece,
      she would let me know as soon as possible what she wanted most. I remarked
      that as I should soon be leaving for Rome, I should like to sup with her
      niece every evening. She thought this a very natural wish on my part, and
      so we went to Callimena, who was delighted to hear the result of our
      interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lost no time, but supped and passed that night with her. I made her all
      my own by the power of my love, and by buying her such things as she most
      needed, such as linen, dresses, etc. It cost me about a hundred louis, and
      in spite of the smallness of my means I thought I had made a good bargain.
      Agatha, whom I told of my good luck, was delighted to have helped me to
      procure it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three days after I gave a dinner to my English friends, the two
      Saxons, Bartoldi their governor, and Goudar and his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were all ready, and only waiting for M. and Madame Goudar, when I saw
      the fair Irishwoman come in with Count Medini. This piece of insolence
      made all the blood in my body rush to my head. However, I restrained
      myself till Goudar came in, and then I gave him a piece of my mind. It had
      been agreed that his wife should come with him. The rascally fellow
      prevaricated, and tried hard to induce me to believe that Medini had not
      plotted the breaking of the bank, but his eloquence was in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our dinner was a most agreeable one, and Sara cut a brilliant figure, for
      she possessed every pleasing quality that can make a woman attractive. In
      good truth, this tavern girl would have filled a throne with any queen;
      but Fortune is blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the dinner was over, M. de Buturlin, a distinguished Russian, and a
      great lover of pretty women, paid me a visit. He had been attracted by the
      sweet voice of the fair Sara, who was singing a Neapolitan air to the
      guitar. I shone only with a borrowed light, but I was far from being
      offended. Buturlin fell in love with Sara on the spot, and a few months
      after I left he got her for five hundred Louis, which Goudar required to
      carry out the order he had received, namely, to leave Naples in three
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      This stroke came from the queen, who found out that the king met Madame
      Goudar secretly at Procida. She found her royal husband laughing heartily
      at a letter which he would not shew her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen&rsquo;s curiosity was excited, and at last the king gave in, and her
      majesty read the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ti aspettero nel medesimo luogo, ed alla stessa ora, coll&rsquo; impazienza
      medesima che ha una vacca che desidera l&rsquo;avicinamento del toro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chi infamia!&rdquo; cried the queen, and her majesty gave the cow&rsquo;s husband to
      understand that in three days he would have to leave Naples, and look for
      bulls in other countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      If these events had not taken place, M. de Buturlin would not have made so
      good a bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      After my dinner, Goudar asked all the company to sup with him the next
      evening. The repast was a magnificent one, but when Medini sat down at the
      end of a long table behind a heap of gold and a pack of cards, no punters
      came forward. Madame Goudar tried in vain to make the gentlemen take a
      hand. The Englishmen and the Saxons said politely that they should be
      delighted to play if she or I would take the bank, but they feared the
      count&rsquo;s extraordinary fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Goudar had the impudence to ask me to deal for a fourth share.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not deal under a half share,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;though I have no
      confidence in my luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goudar spoke to Medini, who got up, took away his share, and left me the
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had only two hundred ounces in my purse. I placed them beside Goudar&rsquo;s
      two hundred, and in two hours my bank was broken, and I went to console
      myself with my Callimena.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding myself penniless I decided to yield to the pressure of Agatha&rsquo;s
      husband, who continued to beg me to take back the jewelry I had given his
      wife. I told Agatha I would never have consented if fortune had been
      kinder to me. She told her husband, and the worthy man came out of his
      closet and embraced me as if I had just made his fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him I should like to have the value of the jewels, and the next day
      I found myself once more in possession of fifteen thousand francs. From
      that moment I decided to go to Rome, intending to stop there for eight
      months; but before my departure the advocate said he must give me a dinner
      at a casino which he had at Portici.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had plenty of food for thought when I found myself in the house where I
      had made a small fortune by my trick with the mercury five-and-twenty
      years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was then at Portici with his Court, and our curiosity attracting
      us we were witnesses of a most singular spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was only nineteen and loved all kinds of frolics. He conceived a
      desire to be tossed in a blanket! Probably few crowned heads have wished
      to imitate Sancho Panza in this manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      His majesty was tossed to his heart&rsquo;s content; but after his aerial
      journeys he wished to laugh at those whom he had amused. He began by
      proposing that the queen should take part in the game; on her replying by
      shrieks of laughter, his majesty did not insist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old courtiers made their escape, greatly to my regret, for I should
      have liked to see them cutting capers in the air, specially Prince Paul
      Nicander, who had been the king&rsquo;s tutor, and had filled him with all his
      own prejudices.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the king saw that his old followers had fled, he was reduced to
      asking the young nobles present to play their part.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not afraid for myself, as I was unknown, and not of sufficient rank
      to merit such an honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      After three or four young noblemen had been tossed, much to the amusement
      of the queen and her ladies, the king cast his eyes on two young
      Florentine nobles who had lately arrived at Naples. They were with their
      tutor, and all three had been laughing heartily at the disport of the king
      and his courtiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monarch came up and accosted them very pleasantly, proposing that they
      should take part in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wretched Tuscans had been baked in a bad oven; they were undersized,
      ugly, and humpbacked.
    </p>
    <p>
      His majesty&rsquo;s proposal seemed to put them on thorns. Everybody listened
      for the effects of the king&rsquo;s eloquence; he was urging them to undress,
      and saying that it would be unmannerly to refuse; there could be no
      humiliation in it, he said, as he himself had been the first to submit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tutor felt that it would not do to give the king a refusal, and told
      them that they must give in, and thereupon the two Florentines took off
      their clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the company saw their figures and doleful expressions, the laughter
      became general. The king took one of them by the hand, observing in an
      encouraging manner that there would be no danger; and as a special honour
      he held one of the corners of the blanket himself. But, for all that, big
      tears rolled down the wretched young man&rsquo;s cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      After three or four visits to the ceiling, and amusing everyone by the
      display of his long thin legs, he was released, and the younger brother
      went to the torture smilingly, for which he was rewarded by applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governor, suspecting that his majesty destined him for the same fate,
      had slipped out; and the king laughed merrily when he heard of his
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the extraordinary spectacle we enjoyed&mdash;a spectacle in every
      way unique.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pascal Latilla, who had been lucky enough to avoid his majesty&rsquo;s
      notice, told us a number of pleasant anecdotes about the king; all shewed
      him in the amiable light of a friend of mirth and an enemy to all pomp and
      stateliness, by which kings are hedged in generally. He assured us that no
      one could help liking him, because he always preferred to be treated as a
      friend rather than a monarch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is never more grieved,&rdquo; said Pascal, &ldquo;than when his minister Tanucci
      shews him that he must be severe, and his greatest joy is to grant a
      favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferdinand had not the least tincture of letters, but as he was a man of
      good sense he honoured lettered men most highly, indeed anyone of merit
      was sure of his patronage. He revered the minister Marco, he had the
      greatest respect for the memory of Lelio Caraffa, and of the Dukes of
      Matalone, and he had provided handsomely for a nephew of the famous man of
      letters Genovesi, in consideration of his uncle&rsquo;s merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Games of chance were forbidden; and one day he surprised a number of the
      officers of his guard playing at faro. The young men were terrified at the
      sight of the king, and would have hidden their cards and money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put yourselves out,&rdquo; said the kindly monarch, &ldquo;take care that
      Tanucci doesn&rsquo;t catch you, but don&rsquo;t mind me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His father was extremely fond of him up to the time when he was obliged to
      resist the paternal orders in deference to State reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferdinand knew that though he was the King of Spain&rsquo;s son, he was none the
      less king of the two Sicilies, and his duties as king had the prerogative
      over his duties as son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some months after the suppression of the Jesuits, he wrote his father a
      letter, beginning:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are four things which astonish me very much. The first is that
      though the Jesuits were said to be so rich, not a penny was found upon
      them at the suppression; the second, that though the Scrivani of Naples
      are supposed to take no fees, yet their wealth is immense; the third, that
      while all the other young couples have children sooner or later, we have
      none; and the fourth, that all men die at last, except Tanucci, who, I
      believe, will live on in &lsquo;saecula saeculorum&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The King of Spain shewed this letter to all the ministers and ambassadors,
      that they might see that his son was a clever man, and he was right; for a
      man who can write such a letter must be clever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three days later, the Chevalier de Morosini, the nephew of the
      procurator, and sole heir of the illustrious house of Morosini, came to
      Naples accompanied by his tutor Stratico, the professor of mathematics at
      Padua, and the same that had given me a letter for his brother, the Pisan
      professor. He stayed at the &ldquo;Crocielles,&rdquo; and we were delighted to see one
      another again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morosini, a young man of nineteen, was travelling to complete his
      education. He had spent three years at Turin academy, and was now under
      the superintendence of a man who could have introduced him to the whole
      range of learning, but unhappily the will was wanting in the pupil. The
      young Venetian loved women to excess, frequented the society of young
      rakes, and yawned in good company. He was a sworn foe to study, and spent
      his money in a lavish manner, less from generosity than from a desire to
      be revenged on his uncle&rsquo;s economies. He complained of being still kept in
      tutelage; he had calculated that he could spend eight hundred sequins a
      month, and thought his allowance of two hundred sequins a month an insult.
      With this notion, he set himself to sow debts broadcast, and only laughed
      at his tutor when he mildly reproached him for his extravagance, and
      pointed out that if he were saving for the present, he would be able to be
      all the more magnificent on his return to Venice. His uncle had made an
      excellent match for him; he was to marry a girl who was extremely pretty,
      and also the heiress of the house of Grimani de Servi.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only redeeming feature in the young man&rsquo;s character was that he had a
      mortal hatred of all kinds of play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since my bank had been broken I had been at Goudar&rsquo;s, but I would not
      listen to his proposal that I should join them again. Medini had become a
      sworn foe of mine. As soon as I came, he would go away, but I pretended
      not to notice him. He was at Goudar&rsquo;s when I introduced Morosini and his
      mentor, and thinking the young man good game he became very intimate with
      him. When he found out that Morosini would not hear of gaming, his hatred
      of me increased, for he was certain that I had warned the rich Venetian
      against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morosini was much taken with Sara&rsquo;s charms, and only thought of how he
      could possess her. He was still a young man, full of romantic notions, and
      she would have become odious in his eyes if he could have guessed that she
      would have to be bought with a heavy price.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told me several times that if a woman proposed payment for her favours,
      his disgust would expel his love in a moment. As he said, and rightly, he
      was as good a man as Madame Goudar was a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was distinctly a good point in his character; no woman who gave her
      favours in exchange for presents received could hope to dupe him. Sara&rsquo;s
      maxims were diametrically opposed to his; she looked on her love as a bill
      of exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stratico was delighted to see him engaged in this intrigue, for the chief
      point in dealing with him was to keep him occupied. If he had no
      distractions he took refuge in bad company or furious riding. He would
      sometimes ride ten or twelve stages at full gallop, utterly ruining the
      horses. He was only too glad to make his uncle pay for them, as he swore
      he was an old miser.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I had made up my mind to leave Naples, I had a visit from Don Pascal
      Latilla, who brought with him the Abbe Galiani, whom I had known at Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be remembered that I had known his brother at St. Agatha&rsquo;s, where I
      had stayed with him, and left him Donna Lucrezia Castelli.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him that I had intended to visit him, and asked if Lucrezia were
      still with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She lives at Salerno,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;with her daughter the Marchioness C&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was delighted to hear the news; if it had not been for the abbe&rsquo;s visit,
      I should never have heard what had become of these ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him if he knew the Marchioness C&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only know the marquis,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;he is old and very rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was enough for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of days afterwards Morosini invited Sara, Goudar, two young
      gamesters, and Medini, to dinner. The latter had not yet given up hopes of
      cheating the chevalier in one way or another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of dinner it happened that Medini differed in opinion from
      me, and expressed his views in such a peremptory manner that I remarked
      that a gentleman would be rather more choice in his expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but I am not going to learn manners from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I constrained myself, and said nothing, but I was getting tired of his
      insolence; and as he might imagine that my resentment was caused by fear,
      I determined on disabusing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was taking his coffee on the balcony overlooking the sea, I came up
      to him with my cup in my hand, and said that I was tired of the rudeness
      with which he treated me in company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would find me ruder still,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;if we could meet without
      company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I could convince you of your mistake if we could have a private
      meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should very much like to see you do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you see me go out, follow me, and don&rsquo;t say a word to anyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rejoined the company, and walked slowly towards Pausilippo. I looked
      back and saw him following me; and as he was a brave fellow, and we both
      had our swords, I felt sure the thing would soon be settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I found myself in the open country, where we should not be
      interrupted, I stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he drew near I attempted a parley, thinking that we might come to a
      more amicable settlement; but the fellow rushed on me with his sword in
      one hand and his hat in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lunged out at him, and instead of attempting to parry he replied in
      quart. The result was that our blades were caught in each other&rsquo;s sleeves;
      but I had slit his arm, while his point had only pierced the stuff of my
      coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I put myself on guard again to go on, but I could see he was too weak to
      defend himself, so I said if he liked I would give him quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply, so I pressed on him, struck him to the ground, and
      trampled on his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      He foamed with rage, and told me that it was my turn this time, but that
      he hoped I would give him his revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure, at Rome, and I hope the third lesson will be more
      effectual than the two I have already given you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was losing a good deal of blood, so I sheathed his sword for him and
      advised him to go to Goudar&rsquo;s house, which was close at hand, and have his
      wound attended to.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went back to &ldquo;Crocielles&rdquo; as if nothing had happened. The chevalier was
      making love to Sara, and the rest were playing cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left the company an hour afterwards without having said a word about my
      duel, and for the last time I supped with Callimena. Six years later I saw
      her at Venice, displaying her beauty and her talents on the boards of St.
      Benedict&rsquo;s Theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent a delicious night with her, and at eight o&rsquo;clock the next day I
      went off in a post-chaise without taking leave of anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I arrived at Salerno at two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and as soon as I had
      taken a room I wrote a note to Donna Lucrezia Castelli at the Marquis C&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked her if I could pay her a short visit, and begged her to send a
      reply while I was taking my dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sitting down to table when I had the pleasure of seeing Lucrezia
      herself come in. She gave a cry of delight and rushed to my arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      This excellent woman was exactly my own age, but she would have been taken
      for fifteen years younger.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I had told her how I had come to hear about her I asked for news of
      our daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is longing to see you, and her husband too; he is a worthy old man,
      and will be so glad to know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does he know of my existence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leonilda has mentioned your name a thousand times during the five years
      they have been married. He is aware that you gave her five thousand
      ducats. We shall sup together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go directly; I cannot rest till I have seen my Leonilda and the
      good husband God has given her. Have they any children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, unluckily for her, as after his death the property passes to his
      relations. But Leonilda will be a rich woman for all that; she will have a
      hundred thousand ducats of her own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have never married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are as pretty as you were twenty-six years ago, and if it had not
      been for the Abbe Galiani I should have left Naples without seeing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I found Leonilda had developed into a perfect beauty. She was at that time
      twenty-three years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband&rsquo;s presence was no constraint upon her; she received me with
      open arms, and put me completely at my ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt she was my daughter, but in spite of our relationship and my
      advancing years I still felt within my breast the symptoms of the
      tenderest passion for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She presented me to her husband, who suffered dreadfully from gout, and
      could not stir from his arm-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He received me with smiling face and open arms, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend, embrace me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I embraced him affectionately, and in our greeting I discovered that he
      was a brother mason. The marquis had expected as much, but I had not; for
      a nobleman of sixty who could boast that he had been enlightened was a
      &lsquo;rara avis&rsquo; in the domains of his Sicilian majesty thirty years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat down beside him and we embraced each other again, while the ladies
      looked on amazed, wondering to see us so friendly to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Leonilda fancied that we must be old friends, and told her husband
      how delighted she was. The old man burst out laughing, and Lucrezia
      suspecting the truth bit her lips and said nothing. The fair marchioness
      reserved her curiosity for another reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis had seen the whole of Europe. He had only thought of marrying
      on the death of his father, who had attained the age of ninety. Finding
      himself in the enjoyment of thirty thousand ducats a year he imagined that
      he might yet have children in spite of his advanced age. He saw Leonilda,
      and in a few days he made her his wife, giving her a dowry of a hundred
      thousand ducats. Donna Lucrezia went to live with her daughter. Though the
      marquis lived magnificently, he found it difficult to spend more than half
      his income.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lodged all his relations in his immense palace; there were three
      families in all, and each lived apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although they were comfortably off they were awaiting with impatience the
      death of the head of the family, as they would then share his riches. The
      marquis had only married in the hope of having an heir; and these hopes he
      could no longer entertain. However, he loved his wife none the less, while
      she made him happy by her charming disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis was a man of liberal views like his wife, but this was a great
      secret, as free thought was not appreciated at Salerno. Consequently, any
      outsider would have taken the household for a truly Christian one, and the
      marquis took care to adopt in appearance all the prejudices of his
      fellow-countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Lucrezia told me all this three hours after as we walked in a
      beautiful garden, where her husband had sent us after a long conversation
      on subjects which could not have been of any interest to the ladies.
      Nevertheless, they did not leave us for a moment, so delighted were they
      to find that the marquis had met a congenial spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      About six o&rsquo;clock the marquis begged Donna Lucrezia to take me to the
      garden and amuse me till the evening. His wife he asked to stay, as he had
      something to say to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the middle of August and the heat was great, but the room on the
      ground floor which we occupied was cooled by a delicious breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked out of the window and noticed that the leaves on the trees were
      still, and that no wind was blowing; and I could not help saying to the
      marquis that I was astonished to find his room as cool as spring in the
      heats of summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sweetheart will explain it to you,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went through several apartments, and at last reached a closet, in one
      corner of which was a square opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      From it rushed a cold and even violent wind. From the opening one could go
      down a stone staircase of at least a hundred steps, and at the bottom was
      a grotto where was the source of a stream of water as cold as ice. Donna
      Lucrezia told me it would be a great risk to go down the steps without
      excessively warm clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have never cared to run risks of this kind. Lord Baltimore, on the other
      hand, would have laughed at the danger, and gone, maybe, to his death. I
      told my old sweetheart that I could imagine the thing very well from the
      description, and that I had no curiosity to see whether my imagination
      were correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucrezia told me I was very prudent, and took me to the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a large place, and separated from the garden common to the three
      other families who inhabited the castle. Every flower that can be imagined
      was there, fountains threw their glittering sprays, and grottoes afforded
      a pleasing shade from the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alleys of this terrestrial paradise were formed of vines, and the
      bunches of grapes seemed almost as numerous as the leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucrezia enjoyed my surprise, and I told her that I was not astonished at
      being more moved by this than by the vines of Tivoli and Frascati. The
      immense rather dazzles the eyes than moves the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told me that her daughter was happy, and that the marquis was an
      excellent man, and a strong man except for the gout. His great grief was
      that he had no children. Amongst his dozen of nephews there was not one
      worthy of succeeding to the title.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are all ugly, awkward lads, more like peasants than noblemen; all
      their education has been given them by a pack of ignorant priests; and so
      it is not to be wondered that the marquis does not care for them much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is Leonilda really happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is, though her husband cannot be quite so ardent as she would like at
      her age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t seem to me to be a very jealous man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is entirely free from jealousy, and if Leonilda would take a lover I
      am sure he would be his best friend. And I feel certain he would be only
      too glad to find the beautiful soil which he cannot fertile himself
      fertilized by another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it positively certain that he is incapable of begetting a child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, when he is well he does his best; but there seems no likelihood of
      his ardour having any happy results. There was some ground to hope in the
      first six months of the marriage, but since he has had the gout so badly
      there seems reason to fear lest his amorous ecstasies should have a fatal
      termination. Sometimes he wants to approach her, but she dare not let him,
      and this pains her very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was struck with a lively sense of Lucrezia&rsquo;s merits, and was just
      revealing to her the sentiments which she had re-awakened in my breast,
      when the marchioness appeared in the garden, followed by a page and a
      young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      I affected great reverence as she came up to us; and as if we had given
      each other the word, she answered me in atone of ceremonious politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come on an affair of the highest importance,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and if I
      fail I shall for ever lose the reputation of a diplomatist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the other diplomatist with whom you are afraid of failing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your battle is over, for I consent before I know what you ask. I
      only make a reserve on one point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the worse, as that may turn out to be just what I want you to do.
      Tell me what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to Rome, when the Abbe Galiani told me that Donna Lucrezia
      was here with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can a short delay interfere with your happiness? Are you not your own
      master?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smile on me once more; your desires are orders which must be obeyed. I
      have always been my own master, but I cease to be so from this moment,
      since I am your most humble servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Then I command you to come and spend a few days with us at an
      estate we have at a short distance. My husband will have himself
      transported here. You will allow me to send to the inn for your luggage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, sweet marchioness, is the key to my room. Happy the mortal whom you
      deign to command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonilda gave the key to the page, a pretty boy, and told him to see that
      all my belongings were carefully taken to the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lady-in-waiting was very fair. I said so to Leonilda in French, not
      knowing that the young lady understood the language, but she smiled and
      told her mistress that we were old acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When had I the pleasure of knowing you, mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine year ago. You have often spoken to me and teased me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Duchess of Matalone&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be, and I think I do begin to remember, but I really cannot
      recollect having teased you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness and her mother were highly amused at this conversation,
      and pressed the girl to say how I had teased her. She confined herself,
      however, to saying that I had played tricks on her. I thought I remembered
      having stolen a few kisses, but I left the ladies to think what they
      liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was a great student of the human heart, and felt that these reproaches
      of Anastasia&rsquo;s (such was her name) were really advances, but unskillfully
      made, for if she had wanted more of me, she should have held her peace and
      bided her time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It strikes me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that you were much smaller in those days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I was only twelve or thirteen. You have changed also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have aged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We began talking about the late Duke of Matalone, and Anastasia left us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat down in a charming grotto, and began styling each other papa and
      daughter, and allowing ourselves liberties which threatened to lead to
      danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness tried to calm my transports by talking of her good
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Lucrezia remarked our mutual emotion as I held Leonilda in my arms,
      and warned us to be careful. She then left us to walk in a different part
      of the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her words had the contrary effect to what was intended, for as soon as she
      left us in so opportune a manner, although we had no intention of
      committing the double crime, we approached too near to each other, and an
      almost involuntary movement made, the act complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      We remained motionless, looking into one another&rsquo;s eyes, in mute
      astonishment, as we confessed afterwards, to find neither guilt nor
      repentance in our breasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rearranged our position, and the marchioness sitting close to me called
      me her dear husband, while I called her my dear wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new bond between us was confirmed by affectionate kisses. We were
      absorbed and silent, and Lucrezia was delighted to find us so calm when
      she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had no need to warn each other to observe secrecy. Donna Lucrezia was
      devoid of prejudice, but there was no need to give her a piece of useless
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      We felt certain that she had left us alone, so as not to be a witness of
      what we were going to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some further conversation we went back to the palace with Anastasia,
      whom we found in the alley by herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis received his wife with joy, congratulating her on the success
      of her negotiations. He thanked me for my compliance, and assured me I
      should have a comfortable apartment in his country house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you will not mind having our friend for a neighbor?&rdquo; he said to
      Lucrezia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but we will be discreet, for the flower of our lives has
      withered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall believe as much of that as I please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The worthy man dearly loved a joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long table was laid for five, and as soon as dinner was served an old
      priest came in and sat down. He spoke to nobody, and nobody spoke to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pretty page stood behind the marchioness, and we were waited on by ten
      or twelve servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had only a little soup at dinner, so I ate like an ogre, for I was very
      hungry, and the marquis&rsquo;s French cook was a thorough artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis exclaimed with delight as I devoured one dish after another.
      He told me that the only fault in his wife that she was a very poor eater
      like her mother. At dessert the wine began to take effect, and our
      conversation, which was conducted in French, became somewhat free. The old
      priest took no notice, as he only understood Italian, and he finally left
      us after saying the &lsquo;agimus&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis told me that this ecclesiastic had been a confessor to the
      palace for the last twenty years, but had never confessed anybody. He
      warned me to take care what I said before him if I spoke Italian, but he
      did not know a word of French.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirth was the order of the day, and I kept the company at table till an
      hour after midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we parted for the night the marquis told me that we would start in
      the afternoon, and that he should arrive an hour before us. He assured his
      wife that he was quite well, and that he hoped to convince her that I had
      made him ten years younger. Leonilda embraced him tenderly, begging him to
      be careful of his health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but get ready to receive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wished them a good night, and a little marquis at nine months from date.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw the bill,&rdquo; said he to me, &ldquo;and to-morrow I will accept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you,&rdquo; said Lucrezia, &ldquo;to do my best to ensure your meeting your
      obligations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Donna Lucrezia took me to my room, where she handed me over to the charge
      of an imposing-looking servant, and wished me a good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      I slept for eight hours in a most comfortable bed, and when I was dressed
      Lucrezia took me to breakfast with the marchioness, who was at her
      toilette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I may draw my bill at nine months?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will very probably be met,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, really; and it will be to you that my husband will owe the happiness
      he has so long desired. He told me so when he left me an hour ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted to add to your mutual happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked so fresh and happy that I longed to kiss her, but I was obliged
      to restrain myself as she was surrounded by her pretty maids.
    </p>
    <p>
      The better to throw any spies off the scent I began to make love to
      Anastasia, and Leonilda pretended to encourage me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feigned a passionate desire, and I could see that I should not have much
      trouble in gaining my suit. I saw I should have to be careful if I did not
      want to be taken at my word; I could not bear such a surfeit of pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went to breakfast with the marquis, who was delighted to see us. He was
      quite well, except the gout which prevented his walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast we heard mass, and I saw about twenty servants in the
      chapel. After the service I kept the marquis company till dinner-time. He
      said I was very good to sacrifice the company of the ladies for his sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner we set out for his country house; I in a carriage with the
      two ladies, and the marquis in a litter borne by two mules.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an hour and a half we arrived at his fine and well-situated castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing the marchioness did was to take me into the garden, where
      my ardour returned and she once more abandoned herself to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We agreed that I should only go to her room to court Anastasia, as it was
      necessary to avoid the slightest suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fancy of mine for his wife&rsquo;s maid amused the marquis, for his wife
      kept him well posted in the progress of our intrigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Lucrezia approved of the arrangement as she did not want the marquis
      to think that I had only come to Salerno for her sake. My apartments were
      next to Leonilda&rsquo;s, but before I could get into her room I should be
      obliged to pass through that occupied by Anastasia, who slept with another
      maid still prettier than herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis came an hour later, and he said he would get his people to
      carry him in an arm-chair round the gardens, so that he might point out
      their beauties to me. After supper he felt tired and went to bed, leaving
      me to entertain the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few moments&rsquo; conversation, I led the marchioness to her room, and
      she said I had better go to my own apartment through the maids&rsquo; room,
      telling Anastasia to shew me the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Politeness obliged me to shew myself sensible of such a favour, and I said
      I hoped she would not be so harsh as to lock her door upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall lock my door,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;because it is my duty to do so. This
      room is my mistress&rsquo;s closet, and my companion would probably make some
      remark if I left the door open contrary to my usual custom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your reasons are too good for me to overcome, but will you not sit down
      beside me for a few minutes and help me to recollect how I used to tease
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to recollect anything about it; please let me go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must please yourself,&rdquo; said I; and after embracing her and giving her
      a kiss, I wished her good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      My servant came in as she went out, and I told him that I would sleep by
      myself for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the marchioness laughingly repeated the whole of my
      conversation with Anastasia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I applauded her virtuous resistance, but I said she might safely assist
      at your toilette every evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonilda gave the marquis a full account of my talk with Anastasia. The
      old man thought I was really in love with her, and had her in to supper
      for my sake, so I was in common decency bound to play the lover. Anastasia
      was highly pleased at my preferring her to her charming mistress, and at
      the latter&rsquo;s complaisance towards our love-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis in his turn was equally pleased as he thought the intrigue
      would make me stay longer at his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening Anastasia accompanied me to my room with a candle, and
      seeing that I had no valet she insisted combing my hair. She felt
      flattered at my not presuming to go to bed in her presence, and kept me
      company for an hour; and as I was not really amorous of her, I had no
      difficulty in playing the part of the timid lover. When she wished me good
      night she was delighted to find my kisses as affectionate but not so
      daring as those of the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness said, the next morning, that if the recital she had heard
      were true, she was afraid Anastasia&rsquo;s company tired me, as she very well
      knew that when I really loved I cast timidity to the winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she doesn&rsquo;t tire me at all; she is pretty and amusing. But how can
      you imagine that I really love her, when you know very well that the whole
      affair is only designed to cast dust in everyone&rsquo;s eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anastasia fully believes that you adore her, and indeed I am not sorry
      that you should give her a little taste for gallantry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can persuade her to leave her door open I can easily visit you, for
      she will not imagine for a moment that after leaving her I go to your room
      instead of my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care how you set about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see what I can do this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marquis and Lucrezia had not the slightest doubt that Anastasia spent
      every night with me, and they were delighted at the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of the day I devoted to the worthy marquis, who said my company
      made him happy. It was no sacrifice on my part, for I liked his principles
      and his way of thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the occasion of my third supper with Anastasia I was more tender than
      ever, and she was very much astonished to find that I had cooled down when
      I got to my room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to see you so calm,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you quite frightened me at
      supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reason is that I know you think yourself in danger when you are alone
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; you are much more discreet than you were nine years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What folly did I commit then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No folly, but you did not respect my childhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only gave you a few caresses, for which I am now sorry, as you are
      frightened of me, and persist in locking your door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mistrust you, but I have told you my reasons for locking the
      door. I think that you must mistrust me, as you won&rsquo;t go to bed while I am
      in the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must think me very presumptuous. I will go to bed, but you must not
      leave me without giving me a kiss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went to bed, and Anastasia spent half an hour beside me. I had a good
      deal of difficulty in controlling myself, but I was afraid of her telling
      the marchioness everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she left me she gave me such a kind embrace that I could bear it no
      longer, and guiding her hand I shewed her the power she exercised over me.
      She then went away, and I shall not say whether my behaviour irritated or
      pleased her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I was curious to know how much she had told the marchioness,
      and on hearing nothing of the principal fact I felt certain she would not
      lock her door that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the evening came I defied her to shew the same confidence in me as I
      had shewn in her. She replied that she would do so with pleasure, if I
      would blow out my candle and promise not to put my hand on her. I easily
      gave her the required promise, for I meant to keep myself fresh for
      Leonilda.
    </p>
    <p>
      I undressed hastily, followed her with bare feet, and laid myself beside
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took my hands and held them, to which I offered no resistance. We were
      afraid of awakening her bedfellow, and kept perfect silence. Our lips
      however gave themselves free course, and certain motions, natural under
      the circumstances, must have made her believe that I was in torments. The
      half hour I passed beside her seemed extremely long to me, but it must
      have been delicious to her, as giving her the idea that she could do what
      she liked with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I left her after we had shared an ecstatic embrace, I returned to my
      room, leaving the door open. As soon as I had reason to suppose that she
      was asleep, I returned, and passed through her room to Leonilda&rsquo;s. She was
      expecting me, but did not know of my presence till I notified it with a
      kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I had given her a strong proof of my love, I told her of my
      adventure with Anastasia, and then our amorous exploits began again, and I
      did not leave her till I had spent two most delicious hours. We agreed
      that they should not be the last, and I returned to my room on tiptoe as I
      had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not get up till noon, and the marquis and his wife jested with me at
      dinner on the subject of my late rising. At supper it was Anastasia&rsquo;s
      turn, and she seemed to enjoy the situation. She told me in the evening
      that she would not lock her door, but that I must not come into her room,
      as it was dangerous. It would be much better, she said, for us to talk in
      my room, where there would be no need of putting out the light. She added
      that I had better go to bed, as then she would feel certain that she was
      not tiring me in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not say no, but I flattered myself that I would keep my strength
      intact for Leonilda.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reckoned without my host, as the proverb goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I held Anastasia between my arms in bed, her lips glued to mine, I
      told her, as in duty bound, that she did not trust in me enough to lie
      beside me with her clothes off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon she asked me if I would be very discreet.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had said no, I should have looked a fool. I made up my mind, and told
      her yes, determined to satisfy the pretty girl&rsquo;s desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment she was in my arms, not at all inclined to keep me to my
      promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Appetite, it is said, comes in eating. Her ardour made me amorous, and I
      rendered homage to her charms till I fell asleep with fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anastasia left me while I was asleep, and when I awoke I found myself in
      the somewhat ridiculous position of being obliged to make a full
      confession to the marchioness as to why I had failed in my duties to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I told Leonilda my tale, she began to laugh and agreed that further
      visits were out of the question. We made up our minds, and for the
      remainder of my visit our amorous meetings only took place in the
      summerhouses in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to receive Anastasia every night, and when I left for Rome and did
      not take her with me she considered me as a traitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy marquis gave me a great surprise on the eve of my departure. We
      were alone together, and he began by saying that the Duke of Matalone had
      told him the reason which had prevented me marrying Leonilda, and that he
      had always admired my generosity in making her a present of five thousand
      ducats, though I was far from rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These five thousand ducats,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;with seven thousand from the
      duke, composed her dower, and I have added a hundred thousand, so that she
      is sure of a comfortable living, even if I die without a successor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I want you to take back the five thousand ducats you gave her; and
      she herself is as desirous of your doing so as I am. She did not like to
      ask you herself; she is too delicate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should have refused Leonilda if she had asked me, but I accept
      this mark of your friendship. A refusal would have borne witness to
      nothing but a foolish pride, as I am a poor man. I should like Leonilda
      and her mother to be present when you give me the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Embrace me; we will do our business after dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Naples has always been a temple of fortune to me, but if I went there now
      I should starve. Fortune flouts old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonilda and Lucrezia wept with joy when the good marquis gave me the five
      thousand ducats in bank notes, and presented his mother-in-law with an
      equal sum in witness of his gratitude to her for having introduced me to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis was discreet enough not to reveal his chief reason. Donna
      Lucrezia did not know that the Duke of Matalone had told him that Leonilda
      was my daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      An excess of gratitude lessened my high spirits for the rest of the day,
      and Anastasia did not spend a very lively night with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went off at eight o&rsquo;clock the next morning. I was sad, and the whole
      house was in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      I promised that I would write to the marquis from Rome, and I reached
      Naples at eleven o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to see Agatha, who was astonished at my appearance as she had
      thought I was at Rome. Her husband welcomed me in the most friendly
      manner, although he was suffering a great deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said I would dine with them and start directly afterwards, and I asked
      the advocate to get me a bill on Rome for five thousand ducats, in
      exchange for the bank notes I gave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agatha saw that my mind was made up, and without endeavoring to persuade
      me to stay went in search of Callimena.
    </p>
    <p>
      She too had thought I was in Rome, and was in an ecstasy of delight to see
      me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      My sudden disappearance and my unexpected return were the mystery of the
      day, but I did not satisfy anyone&rsquo;s curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left them at three o&rsquo;clock, and stopped at Montecasino, which I had
      never seen. I congratulated myself on my idea, for I met there Prince
      Xaver de Saxe, who was travelling under the name of Comte de Lusace with
      Madame Spinucci, a lady of Fermo, with whom he had contracted a
      semi-clandestine marriage. He had been waiting for three days to hear from
      the Pope, for by St. Benedict&rsquo;s rule women are not allowed in monasteries;
      and as Madame Spinucci was extremely curious on the subject, her husband
      had been obliged to apply for a dispensation to the Holy Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      I slept at Montecasino after having seen the curiosities of the place, and
      I went on to Rome, and put up with Roland&rsquo;s daughter in the Place
      d&rsquo;Espagne.

    <p>
      I had made up my mind to spend a quiet six months at Rome, and the day
      after my arrival I took a pleasant suite of rooms opposite the Spanish
      Ambassador, whose name was d&rsquo;Aspura. It happened to be the same rooms as
      were occupied twenty-seven years ago by the teacher of languages, to whom
      I had gone for lessons while I was with Cardinal Acquaviva. The landlady
      was the wife of a cook who only slept with his better half once a week.
      The woman had a daughter of sixteen or seventeen years old, who would have
      been very pretty if the small-pox had not deprived her of one eye. They
      had provided her with an ill-made artificial eye, of a wrong size and a
      bad colour, which gave a very unpleasant expression to her face.
      Margarita, as she was called, made no impression on me, but I made her a
      present which she valued very highly. There was an English oculist named
      Taylor in Rome at that time, and I got him to make her an eye of the right
      size and colour. This made Margarita imagine that I had fallen in love
      with her, and the mother, a devotee, was in some trouble as to whether my
      intentions were strictly virtuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made arrangements with the mother to supply me with a good dinner and
      supper without any luxury. I had three thousand sequins, and I had made up
      my mind to live in a quiet and respectable manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I found letters for me in several post-offices, and the
      banker Belloni, who had known me for several years, had been already
      advised of my bill of exchange. My good friend Dandolo sent me two letters
      of introduction, of which one was addressed to M. Erizzo, the Venetian
      ambassador. He was the brother of the ambassador to Paris. This letter
      pleased me greatly. The other was addressed to the Duchess of Fiano, by
      her brother M. Zuliani.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that I should be free of all the best houses, and I promised myself
      the pleasure of an early visit to Cardinal Bernis.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not hire either a carriage or a servant. At Rome both these articles
      are procurable at a moment&rsquo;s notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first call was on the Duchess of Fiano. She was an ugly woman, and
      though she was really very good-natured, she assumed the character of
      being malicious so as to obtain some consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband, who bore the name of Ottoboni, had only married her to obtain
      an heir, but the poor devil turned out to be what the Romans call
      &lsquo;babilano&rsquo;, and we impotent. The duchess told me as much on the occasion
      of my third visit. She did not give me the information in a complaining
      tone, or as if she was fain to be consoled, but merely to defy her
      confessor, who had threatened her with excommunication if she went on
      telling people about her husband&rsquo;s condition, or if she tried to cure him
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duchess gave a little supper every evening to her select circle of
      friends. I was not admitted to these reunions for a week or ten days, by
      which time I had made myself generally popular. The duke did not care for
      company and supped apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince of Santa Croce was the duchess&rsquo;s &lsquo;cavaliere servante&rsquo;, and the
      princess was served by Cardinal Bernis. The princess was a daughter of the
      Marquis Falconieri, and was young, pretty, lively, and intended by nature
      for a life of pleasure. However, her pride at possessing the cardinal was
      so great that she did not give any hope to other competitors for her
      favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince was a fine man of distinguished manners and great capability,
      which he employed in business speculations, being of opinion, and rightly,
      that it was no shame for a nobleman to increase his fortune by the
      exercise of his intelligence. He was a careful man, and had attached
      himself to the duchess because she cost him nothing, and he ran no risk of
      falling in love with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three weeks after my arrival he heard me complaining of the
      obstacles to research in the Roman libraries, and he offered to give me an
      introduction to the Superior of the Jesuits. I accepted the offer, and was
      made free of the library; I could not only go and read when I liked, but I
      could, on writing my name down, take books away with me. The keepers of
      the library always brought me candles when it grew dark, and their
      politeness was so great that they gave me the key of a side door, so that
      I could slip in and out as I pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jesuits were always the most polite of the regular clergy, or, indeed,
      I may say the only polite men amongst them; but during the crisis in which
      they were then involved, they were simply cringing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King of Spain had called for the suppression of the order, and the
      Pope had promised that it should be done; but the Jesuits did not think
      that such a blow could ever be struck, and felt almost secure. They did
      not think that the Pope&rsquo;s power was superhuman so far as they were
      concerned. They even intimated to him by indirect channels that his
      authority did not extend to the suppression of the order; but they were
      mistaken. The sovereign pontiff delayed the signature of the bull, but his
      hesitation proceeded from the fact that in signing it he feared lest he
      should be signing his own sentence of death. Accordingly he put it off
      till he found that his honour was threatened. The King of Spain, the most
      obstinate tyrant in Europe, wrote to him with his own hand, telling him
      that if he did not suppress the order he would publish in all the
      languages of Europe the letters he had written when he was a cardinal,
      promising to suppress the order when he became Pope. On the strength of
      these letters Ganganelli had been elected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another man would have taken refuge in casuistry and told the king that it
      was not for a pope to be bound to the cardinal&rsquo;s promises, in which
      contention he would have been supported by the Jesuits. However, in his
      heart Ganganelli had no liking for the Jesuits. He was a Franciscan, and
      not a gentleman by birth. He had not a strong enough intellect to defy the
      king and all his threats, or to bear the shame of being exhibited to the
      whole world as an ambitious and unscrupulous man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am amused when people tell me that Ganganelli poisoned himself by taking
      so many antidotes. It is true that having reason, and good reason, to
      dread poison, he made use of antidotes which, with his ignorance of
      science, might have injured his health; but I am morally certain that he
      died of poison which was given by other hands than his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      My reasons for this opinion are as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year of which I am speaking, the third of the Pontificate of
      Clement XIV., a woman of Viterbo was put in prison on the charge of making
      predictions. She obscurely prophesied the suppression of the Jesuits,
      without giving any indication of the time; but she said very clearly that
      the company would be destroyed by a pope who would only reign five years
      three months and three days&mdash;that is, as long as Sixtus V., not a day
      more and not a day less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody treated the prediction with contempt, as the product of a
      brain-sick woman. She was shut up and quite forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ask my readers to give a dispassionate judgment, and to say whether they
      have any doubt as to the poisoning of Ganganelli when they hear that his
      death verified the prophecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a case like this, moral certainty assumes the force of scientific
      certainty. The spirit which inspired the Pythia of Viterbo took its
      measures to inform the world that if the Jesuits were forced to submit to
      being suppressed, they were not so weak as to forego a fearful vengeance.
      The Jesuit who cut short Ganganelli&rsquo;s days might certainly have poisoned
      him before the bull was signed, but the fact was that they could not bring
      themselves to believe it till it took place. It is clear that if the Pope
      had not suppressed the Jesuits, they would not have poisoned him, and here
      again the prophecy could not be taxed with falsity. We may note that
      Clement XIV., like Sixtus V., was a Franciscan, and both were of low
      birth. It is also noteworthy that after the Pope&rsquo;s death the prophetess
      was liberated, and, though her prophecy had been fulfilled to the letter,
      all the authorities persisted in saying that His Holiness had died from
      his excessive use of antidotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems to me that any impartial judge will scout the idea of Ganganelli
      having killed himself to verify the woman of Viterbo&rsquo;s prediction. If you
      say it was a mere coincidence, of course I cannot absolutely deny your
      position, for it may have been chance; but my thoughts on the subject will
      remain unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      This poisoning was the last sign the Jesuits gave of their power. It was a
      crime, because it was committed after the event, whereas, if it had been
      done before the suppression of the order, it would have been a stroke of
      policy, and might have been justified on politic grounds. The true
      politician looks into the future, and takes swift and certain measures to
      obtain the end he has in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second time that the Prince of Santa Croce saw me at the Duchess of
      Fiano&rsquo;s, he asked me &lsquo;ex abrupta&rsquo; why I did not visit Cardinal Bernis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think of paying my suit to him to-morrow,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so, for I have never heard his eminence speak of anyone with as much
      consideration as he speaks of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been very kind to me, and I shall always be grateful to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal received me the next day with every sign of delight at seeing
      me. He praised the reserve with which I had spoken of him to the prince,
      and said he need not remind me of the necessity for discretion as to our
      old Venetian adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your eminence,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is a little stouter, otherwise you look as fresh
      as ever and not at all changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make a mistake. I am very different from what I was then. I am
      fifty-five now, and then I was thirty-six. Moreover, I am reduced to a
      vegetable diet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that to keep down the lusts of the flesh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish people would think so; but no one does, I am afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was glad to hear that I bore a letter to the Venetian ambassador, which
      I had not yet presented. He said he would take care to give the ambassador
      a prejudice in my favour, and that he would give me a good reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will begin to break the ice to-morrow,&rdquo; added this charming cardinal.
      &ldquo;You shall dine with me, and his excellence shall hear of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard with pleasure that I was well provided for as far as money was
      concerned, and that I had made up my mind to live simply and discreetly so
      long as I remained in Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall write about you to M&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      have always kept up a correspondence with that delightful nun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I then amused him by the talk of my adventure with the nun of Chamberi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to ask the Prince of Santa Croce to introduce you to the
      princess. We might pass some pleasant hours with her, though not in our
      old Venetian style, for the princess is not at all like M&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet she serves to amuse your eminence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have to be content with what I can get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day as I was getting up from dinner the cardinal told me that M.
      Zuliani had written about me to the ambassador, who would be delighted to
      make my acquaintance, and when I went I had an excellent reception from
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chevalier Erizzo, who is still alive, was a man of great intelligence,
      common sense, and oratorical power. He complimented me on my travels and
      on my being protected by the State Inquisitors instead of being persecuted
      by them. He kept me to dinner, and asked me to dine with him whenever I
      had no other engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same evening I met Prince Santa Croce at the duchess&rsquo;s, and asked him
      to introduce me to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been expecting that,&rdquo; he replied &ldquo;even since the cardinal talked
      to her about you for more than an hour. You can call any day at eleven in
      the morning or two in the afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I called the next day at two o&rsquo;clock. She was taking her siesta in bed,
      but as I had the privileges allowed to a person of no consequence she let
      me in directly. She was young, pretty, lively, curious, and talkative; she
      had not enough patience to wait for my answer to her questions. She struck
      me as a toy, well adapted to amuse a man of affairs, who felt the need of
      some distraction. The cardinal saw her regularly three times a day; the
      first thing in the morning he called to ask if she had had a good night,
      at three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon he took coffee with her, and in the
      evening he met her at the assembly. He always played at piquet, and played
      with such talent that he invariably lost six Roman sequins, no more and no
      less. These losses of the cardinal&rsquo;s made the princess the richest young
      wife in Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the marquis was somewhat inclined to be jealous, he could not
      possibly object to his wife enjoying a revenue of eighteen hundred francs
      a month, and that without the least scandal, for everything was done in
      public, and the game was honestly conducted. Why should not fortune fall
      in love with such a pretty woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince of Santa Croce could not fail to appreciate the friendship of
      the cardinal for his wife, who gave him a child every year, and sometimes
      every nine months, in spite of the doctor&rsquo;s warnings to beware of results.
      It was said that to make up for his enforced abstinence during the last
      few days of his wife&rsquo;s pregnancy, the prince immediately set to again when
      the child was being baptized.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friendship of the cardinal for the prince&rsquo;s wife also gave him the
      advantage of getting silks from Lyons without the Pope&rsquo;s treasurer being
      able to say anything, as the packets were addressed to the French
      ambassador. It must also be noted that the cardinal&rsquo;s patronage kept other
      lovers from the house. The High Constable Colonna was very much taken with
      her. The prince had surprised this gentleman talking to the princess in a
      room of the palace and at an hour when she was certain that the cardinal
      would not be in the way. Scarcely had the Colonna gone when the prince
      told his wife that she would accompany him into the country the next day.
      She protested, saying that this sudden order was only a caprice and that
      her honour would not allow of her obeying him. The prince, however, was
      very determined, and she would have been obliged to go if the cardinal had
      not come in and heard the story from the mouth of the innocent princess.
      He shewed the husband that it was to his own interests to go into the
      country by himself, and to let his wife remain in Rome. He spoke for her,
      assuring the prince that she would take more care for the future and avoid
      such meetings, always unpleasant in a house.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than a month I became the shadow of the three principal persons in
      the play. I listened and admired and became as necessary to the personages
      as a marker at billiards. When any of the parties were afflicted I
      consoled them with tales or amusing comments, and, naturally, they were
      grateful to me. The cardinal, the prince, and his fair wife amused each
      other and offended no one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess of Fiano was proud of being the possessor of the prince who
      left his wife to the cardinal, but no one was deceived but herself. The
      good lady wondered why no one acknowledged that the reason why the
      princess never came to see her was mere jealousy. She spoke to me on the
      subject with so much fire that I had to suppress my good sense to keep her
      good graces.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to express my astonishment as to what the cardinal could see in the
      princess, who, according to her, was skinny in person and silly in mind,
      altogether a woman of no consequence. I agreed to all this, but I was far
      from thinking so, for the princess was just the woman to amuse a
      voluptuous and philosophic lover like the cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not help thinking now and again that the cardinal was happier in
      the possession of this treasure of a woman than in his honours and
      dignities.
    </p>
    <p>
      I loved the princess, but as I did not hope for success I confined myself
      strictly to the limits of my position.
    </p>
    <p>
      I might, no doubt, have succeeded, but more probably I should have raised
      her pride against me, and wounded the feelings of the cardinal, who was no
      longer the same as when we shared M&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash; in
      common. He had told me that his affection for her was of a purely fatherly
      character, and I took that as a hint not to trespass on his preserves.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had reason to congratulate myself that she observed no more ceremony
      with me than with her mail. I accordingly pretended to see nothing, while
      she felt certain I saw all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no easy matter to win the confidence of such a woman, especially if
      she be served by a king or a cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      My life at Rome was a tranquil and happy one. Margarita had contrived to
      gain my interest by the assiduity of her attentions. I had no servant, so
      she waited on me night and morning, and her false eye was such an
      excellent match that I quite forgot its falsity. She was a clever, but a
      vain girl, and though at first I had no designs upon her I flattered her
      vanity by my conversation and the little presents I bestowed upon her,
      which enabled her to cut a figure in church on Sundays. So before long I
      had my eyes opened to two facts; the one that she was sure of my love, and
      wondered why I did not declare it; the other, that if I chose I had an
      easy conquest before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I guessed the latter circumstance one day when, after I had asked her to
      tell me her adventures from the age of eleven to that of eighteen, she
      proceeded to tell me tales, the telling of which necessitated her throwing
      all modesty to the winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took the utmost delight in these scandalous narrations, and whenever I
      thought she had told the whole truth I gave her a few pieces of money;
      while whenever I had reason to suppose that she had suppressed some
      interesting circumstances I gave her nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She confessed to me that she no longer possessed that which a maid can
      lose but once, that a friend of hers named Buonacorsi was in the same
      case, and finally she told me the name of the young man who had relieved
      them both of their maidenheads.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had for neighbor a young Piedmontese abbe named Ceruti, on whom
      Margarita was obliged to wait when her mother was too busy. I jested with
      her about him, but she swore there was no lovemaking between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This abbe was a fine man, learned and witty, but he was overwhelmed with
      debt and in very bad odour at Rome on account of an extremely unpleasant
      story of which he was the hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      They said that he had told an Englishman, who was in love with Princess
      Lanti, that she was in want of two hundred sequins, that the Englishman
      had handed over the money to the abbe, and that the latter had
      appropriated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This act of meanness had been brought to light by an explanation between
      the lady and the Englishman. On his saying to the princess that he was
      ready to do anything for her, and that the two hundred sequins he had
      given her were as nothing in comparison with what he was ready to do, she
      indignantly denied all knowledge of the transaction. Everything came out.
      The Englishman begged pardon, and the abbe was excluded from the
      princess&rsquo;s house and the Englishman&rsquo;s also.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Abbe Ceruti was one of those journalists employed to write the weekly
      news of Rome by Bianconi; he and I had in a manner become friends since we
      were neighbours. I saw that he loved Margarita, and I was not in the least
      jealous, but as he was a handsome young fellow I could not believe that
      Margarita was cruel to him. Nevertheless, she assured me that she detested
      him, and that she was very sorry that her mother made her wait on him at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ceruti had already laid himself under obligations to me. He had borrowed a
      score of crowns from me, promising to repay them in a week, and three
      weeks had gone by without my seeing the money. However, I did not ask for
      it, and would have lent him as much more if he had requested me. But I
      must tell the story as it happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever I supped with the Duchess of Fiano I came in late, and Margarita
      waited up for me. Her mother would go to bed. For the sake of amusement I
      used to keep her for an hour or two without caring whether our
      pleasantries disturbed the abbe, who could hear everything we said.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening I came home at midnight and was surprised to find the mother
      waiting for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your daughter?&rdquo; I enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s asleep, and I really cannot allow you to pass the whole night with
      her any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she only stays with me till I get into bed. This new whim wounds my
      feelings. I object to such unworthy suspicions. What has Margarita been
      telling you? If she has made any complaints of me, she has lied, and I
      shall leave your house to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong; Margarita has made no complaints; on the contrary she says
      that you have done nothing to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Do you think there is any harm in a little joking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you might be better employed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And these are your grounds for a suspicion of which you should be
      ashamed, if you are a good Christian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God save me from thinking evil of my neighbour, but I have been informed
      that your laughter and your jests are of such a nature as to be offensive
      to people of morality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is my neighbour the abbe who has been foolish enough to give you
      this information?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you how I heard it, but I have heard it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. To-morrow I shall seek another lodging, so as to afford your
      tender conscience some relief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I attend on you as well as my daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; your daughter makes me laugh, and laughing is beneficial to me,
      whereas you would not make me laugh at all. You have insulted me, and I
      leave your house to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to tell my husband the reason of your departure, and I do
      not want to do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do as you like; that&rsquo;s no business of mine. Go away; I want to
      get into bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to wait on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not; if you want anybody to wait on me, send Margarita.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then wake her up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good woman went her way, and two minutes later, the girl came in with
      little on but her chemise. She had not had time to put in her false eye,
      and her expression was so amusing that I went off into a roar of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sleeping soundly,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;and my mother woke me up all of a
      sudden, and told me to come and wait on you, or else you would leave, and
      my father would think we had been in mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will stay, if you will continue to wait on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to come very much, but we mustn&rsquo;t laugh any more, as the
      abbe has complained of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is the abbe, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is. Our jests and laughter irritate his passions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rascal! We will punish him rarely. If we laughed last night, we will
      laugh ten times louder tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon we began a thousand tricks, accompanied by shouts and shrieks of
      laughter, purposely calculated to drive the little priest desperate. When
      the fun was at its height, the door opened and the mother came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had Margarita&rsquo;s night-cap on my head, and Margarita&rsquo;s face was adorned
      with two huge moustaches, which I had stuck on with ink. Her mother had
      probably anticipated taking us in the fact, but when she came in she was
      obliged to re-echo our shouts of mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do you think our amusements criminal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit; but you see your innocent orgies keep your neighbour awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he had better go and sleep somewhere else; I am not going to put
      myself out for him. I will even say that you must choose between him and
      me; if I consent to stay with you, you must send him away, and I will take
      his room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t send him away before the end of the month, and I am afraid he
      will say things to my husband which will disturb the peace of the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you he shall go to-morrow and say nothing at all. Leave him to
      me; the abbe shall leave of his own free will, without giving you the
      slightest trouble. In future be afraid for your daughter when she is alone
      with a man and you don&rsquo;t hear laughing. When one does not laugh, one does
      something serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this the mother seemed satisfied and went off to bed. Margarita was
      in such high spirits over the promised dismissal of the abbe that I could
      not resist doing her justice. We passed an hour together without laughing,
      and she left me very proud of the victory she had gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the next day I paid the abbe a visit, and after reproaching him for
      his behaviour I gave him his choice between paying me the money he owed me
      and leaving the house at once. He did his best to get out of the dilemma,
      but seeing that I was pitiless he said he could not leave without paying a
      few small sums he owed the landlord, and without the wherewithal to obtain
      another lodging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I will present you with another twenty crowns; but
      you must go to-day, and not say a word to anyone, unless you wish me to
      become your implacable enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thus got rid of him and entered into possession of the two rooms.
      Margarita was always at my disposal, and after a few days so was the fair
      Buonacorsi, who was much the prettier of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two girls introduced me to the young man who had seduced them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a lad of fifteen or sixteen, and very handsome though short. Nature
      had endowed him with an enormous symbol of virility, and at Lampsacus he
      would no doubt have had an altar erected to him beside that of Priapus,
      with which divinity he might well have contended.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was well-mannered and agreeable, and seemed much above a common
      workman. He did not love Margarita or Mdlle. Bounacorsi; he had merely
      satisfied their curiosity. They saw and admired, and wished to come to a
      nearer acquaintance; he read their minds and offered to satisfy them.
      Thereupon the two girls held a consultation, and pretending to submit out
      of mere complaisance; the double deed was done. I liked this young man,
      and gave him linen and clothes. So before long he had complete confidence
      in me. He told me he was in love with a girl, but unhappily for him she
      was in a convent, and not being able to win her he was becoming desperate.
      The chief obstacle to the match lay in the fact that his earnings only
      amounted to a paolo a day, which was certainly an insufficient sum to
      support a wife on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked so much about her that I became curious, and expressed a desire
      to see her. But before coming to this I must recite some other incidents
      of my stay at Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day I went to the Capitol to see the prizes given to the art students,
      and the first face I saw was the face of Mengs. He was with Battoni and
      two or three other painters, all being occupied in adjudging the merits of
      the various pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not forgotten his treatment of me at Madrid, so I pretended not to
      see him; but as soon as he saw me, he came up and addressed me as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Casanova, let us forget what happened at Madrid and be friends
      once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it, provided no allusion is made to the cause of our quarrel; for I
      warn you that I cannot speak of it and keep my head cool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say; but if you had understood my position at Madrid you would
      never have obliged me to take a course which gave me great pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say not. You must know, then, that I was strongly suspected of
      being a Protestant; and if I had shewn myself indifferent to your conduct,
      I might possibly have been ruined. But dine with me tomorrow; we will make
      up a party of friends, and discuss our quarrel in a good bottle of wine. I
      know that you do not receive your brother, so he shall not be there.
      Indeed, I do not receive him myself, for if I did all honest people would
      give me the cold shoulder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I accepted his friendly invitation, and was punctual to the appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      My brother left Rome a short time afterwards with Prince Beloselski, the
      Russian ambassador to Dresden, with whom he had come; but his visit was
      unsuccessful, as Rezzonico proved inexorable. We only saw each other two
      or three times at Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three or four days after he had gone I had the agreeable surprise of
      seeing my brother the priest, in rags as usual. He had the impudence to
      ask me to help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Venice; I had to leave the place, as I could no longer make a living
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how do you think of making a living at Rome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By saying masses and teaching French.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You a teacher of languages! Why, you do not know your native tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know Italian and French too, and I have already got two pupils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will no doubt make wonderful progress under your fostering care. Who
      are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The son and daughter of the inn-keeper, at whose house I am staying. But
      that&rsquo;s not enough to keep me, and you must give me something while I am
      starting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no right to count on me. Leave the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I would not listen to another word, and told Margarita to see that he did
      not come in again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wretched fellow did his best to ruin me with all my friends, including
      the Duchess of Fiano and the Abbe Gama. Everybody told me that I should
      either give him some help, or get him out of Rome; I got heartily sick of
      the sound of his name. At last the Abbe Ceruti came and told me that if I
      did not want to see my brother begging his bread in the streets I must
      give him some assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can keep him out of Rome,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and he is ready to go if you
      will allow him three paoli a day.&rdquo; I consented, and Ceruti hit on a plan
      which pleased me very much. He spoke to a priest who served a convent of
      Franciscan nuns. This priest took my brother into his service, and gave
      him three paoli for saying one mass every day. If he could preach well he
      might earn more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the Abbe Casanova passed away, and I did not care whether he knew or
      not where the three paoli had come from. As long as I stayed at Rome the
      nine piastres a month came in regularly, but after my departure he
      returned to Rome, went to another convent, and died there suddenly
      thirteen or fourteen years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medini had also arrived in Rome, but we had not seen each other. He lived
      in the street of the Ursulines at the house of one of the Pope&rsquo;s
      light-cavalry men, and subsisted on the money he cheated strangers of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rascal had done well and had sent to Mantua for his mistress, who came
      with her mother and a very pretty girl of twelve or thirteen. Thinking it
      would be to his advantage to take handsome furnished apartments he moved
      to the Place d&rsquo;Espagne, and occupied a house four or five doors from me,
      but I knew nothing of all this at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happening to dine one day with the Venetian ambassador, his excellency
      told me that I should meet a certain Count Manucci who had just arrived
      from Paris, and had evinced much delight on learning that I was at Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you know him well,&rdquo; said the ambassador, &ldquo;and as I am going to
      present him to the Holy Father to-morrow, I should be much obliged if you
      could tell me who he really is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew him at Madrid, where he lived with Mocenigo our ambassador; he is
      well mannered, polite, and a fine looking young man, and that&rsquo;s all I know
      about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he received at the Spanish Court?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so, but I cannot be positive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think he was not received; but I see that you won&rsquo;t tell me all
      you know about him. It&rsquo;s of no consequence; I shall run no risk in
      presenting him to the Pope. He says he is descended from Manucci, the
      famous traveller of the thirteenth century, and from the celebrated
      printers of the same name who did so much for literature. He shewed me the
      Aldine anchor on his coat of arms which has sixteen quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was astonished beyond measure that this man who had plotted my
      assassination should speak of me as an intimate friend, and I determined
      to conceal my feelings and await events. I did not shew the least sign of
      anger, and when after greeting the ambassador he came up to me with open
      arms, I received him cordially and asked after Mocenigo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manucci talked a great deal at dinner, telling a score of lies, all in my
      honour, about my reception at Madrid. I believe his object was to force me
      to lie too, and to make me do the same for him another time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I swallowed all these bitter pills, for I had no choice in the matter, but
      I made up my mind I would have a thorough explanation the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Frenchman, the Chevalier de Neuville by name, who had come with Manucci,
      interested me a great deal. He had come to Rome to endeavour to obtain the
      annulment of marriage of a lady who was in a convent at Mantua. He had a
      special recommendation to Cardinal Galli.
    </p>
    <p>
      His conversation was particularly agreeable, and when we left the
      ambassador&rsquo;s I accepted the offer to come into his carriage with Manucci,
      and we drove about till the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we were returning at nightfall he told us that he was going to present
      us to a pretty girl with whom we would sup and where we should have a game
      of faro.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage stopped at the Place d&rsquo;Espagne, at a short distance from my
      lodging, and we went up to a room on the second floor. When I went in I
      was surprised to see Count Medini and his mistress, the lady whom the
      chevalier had praised, and whom I found not at all to my taste. Medini
      received me cordially, and thanked the Frenchman for having made me forget
      the past, and having brought me to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Neuville looked astonished, and to avoid any unpleasant explanations
      I turned the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Medini thought a sufficient number of punters were present he sat
      down at a large table, placed five or six hundred crowns in gold and notes
      before him, and began to deal. Manucci lost all the gold he had about him,
      Neuville swept away half the bank, and I was content with the humble part
      of spectator.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper, Medini asked the chevalier to give him his revenge, and
      Manucci asked me to lend him a hundred sequins. I did so, and in an hour
      he had not one left. Neuville, on the other hand, brought down Medini&rsquo;s
      bank to twenty or thirty sequins, and after that we retired to our several
      homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manucci lodged with my sister-in-law, Roland&rsquo;s daughter, and I had made up
      my mind to give him an early call; but he did not leave me the
      opportunity, as he called on me early in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      After returning me the hundred sequins he embraced me affectionately, and,
      shewing me a large letter of credit on Bettoni, said that I must consider
      his purse as mine. In short, though he said nothing about the past, he
      gave me to understand that he wished to initiate a mutual policy of forget
      and forgive.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion my heart proved too strong for my brain; such has often
      been the case with me. I agreed to the articles of peace he offered and
      required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, I was no longer at that headstrong age which only knows one kind
      of satisfaction, that of the sword. I remembered that if Manucci had been
      wrong so had I, and I felt that my honour ran no danger of being
      compromised.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after, I went to dinner with him. The Chevalier de Neuville came
      in towards the close of the meal, and Medini a few moments later. The
      latter called on us to hold a bank, each in his turn, and we agreed.
      Manucci gained double what he had lost; Neuvilie lost four hundred
      sequins, and I only lost a trifle. Medini who had only lost about fifty
      sequins was desperate, and would have thrown himself out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later Manucci set out for Naples, after giving a hundred louis
      to Medini&rsquo;s mistress, who used to sup with him; but this windfall did not
      save Medini from being imprisoned for debt, his liabilities amounting to
      more than a thousand crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor wretch wrote me doleful epistles, entreating me to come to his
      assistance; but the sole effect of his letters was to make me look after
      what he called his family, repaying myself with the enjoyment of his
      mistress&rsquo;s young sister. I did not feel called upon to behave generously
      to him for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time the Emperor of Germany came to Rome with his brother, the
      Grand Duke of Tuscany.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the noblemen in their suite made the girl&rsquo;s acquaintance, and gave
      Medini enough to satisfy his creditors. He left Rome soon after recovering
      his liberty, and we shall meet him again in a few months.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lived very happily amongst the friends I had made for myself. In the
      evenings I visited the Duchess of Fiano, in the afternoons the Princess of
      Santa Croce. The rest of my time I spent at home, where I had Margarita,
      the fair Buonacorsi, and young Menicuccio, who told me so much about his
      lady-love that I felt quite curious to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was in a kind of convent where she had been placed out of
      charity. She could only leave it to get married, with the consent of the
      cardinal who superintended the establishment. When a girl went out and got
      married, she received a dower of two hundred Roman crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Menicuccio had a sister in the same convent, and was allowed to visit her
      on Sundays; she came to the grating, followed by her governess. Though
      Menicuccio was her brother, she was not permitted to see him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five or six months before the date of which I am writing his sister had
      been accompanied to the grating by another girl, whom he had never seen
      before, and he immediately fell in love with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor young man had to work hard all the week, and could only visit the
      convent on holidays; and even then he had rarely the good luck to see his
      lady-love. In five or six months he had only seen her seven or eight
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sister knew of his love, and would have done all in her power for him,
      but the choice of a companion did not rest with her, and she was afraid of
      asking for this particular girl for fear of exciting suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have said, I had made up my mind to pay the place a visit, and on our
      way Menicuccio told me that the women of the convent were not nuns,
      properly speaking, as they had never taken any vow and did not wear a
      monastic dress. In spite of that they had few temptations to leave their
      prison house, as they would only find themselves alone in the world with
      the prospect of starvation or hard work before them. The young girls only
      came out to get married, which was uncommon, or by flight, which was
      extremely difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reached a vast ill-built house, near one of the town gates&mdash;a
      lonely and deserted situation, as the gate led to no highway. When we went
      into the parlour I was astonished to see the double grating with bars so
      thick and close together that the hand of a girl of ten could scarce have
      got through. The grating was so close that it was extremely difficult to
      make out the features of the persons standing on the inner side,
      especially as this was only lighted by the uncertain reflection from the
      outer room. The sight of these arrangements made me shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How and where have you seen your mistress?&rdquo; I asked Menicuccio; &ldquo;for
      there I see nothing but darkness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first time the governess chanced to have a candle, but this privilege
      is confined, under pain of excommunication, to relations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she will have a light to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect not, as the portress will have sent up word that there was a
      stranger with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how could you see your sweetheart, as you are not related to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By chance; the first time she came my sister&rsquo;s governess&mdash;a good
      soul&mdash;said nothing about it. Ever since there has been no candle when
      she has been present.&rdquo; Soon after, the forms of three or four women were
      dimly to be seen; but there was no candle, and the governess would not
      bring one on any consideration. She was afraid of being found out and
      excommunicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that I was depriving my young friend of a pleasure, and would have
      gone, but he told me to stay. I passed an hour which interested me in
      spite of its painfulness. The voice of Menicuccio&rsquo;s sister sent a thrill
      through me, and I fancied that the blind must fall in love through their
      sense of hearing. The governess was a woman under thirty. She told me that
      when the girls attained their twenty-fifth year they were placed in charge
      of the younger ones, and at thirty-five they were free to leave the
      convent if they liked, but that few cared to take this step, for fear of
      falling into misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there are a good many old women here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are a hundred of us, and the number is only decreased by death and
      by occasional marriages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how do those who go out to get married succeed in inspiring the love
      of their husbands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been here for twenty years, and in that time only four have gone
      out, and they did not know their husbands till they met at the altar. As
      might be expected, the men who solicit the cardinal for our hands are
      either madmen, or fellows of desperate fortunes who want the two hundred
      piastres. However, the cardinal-superintendent refuses permission unless
      the postulant can satisfy him that he is capable of supporting a wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does he choose his bride?&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;He tells the cardinal what age and disposition he would prefer, and the
      cardinal informs the mother-superior.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you keep a good table, and are comfortably lodged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. Three thousand crowns a year are not much to keep a hundred
      persons. Those who do a little work and earn something are the best off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What manner of people put their daughters in such a prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either poor people or bigots who are afraid of their children falling
      into evil ways. We only receive pretty girls here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the judge of their prettiness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The parents, the priest, and on the last appeal the
      cardinal-superintendent, who rejects plain girls without pity, observing
      that ugly women have no reason to fear the seductions of vice. So you may
      imagine that, wretched as we are, we curse those who pronounced us
      pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pity you, and I wonder why leave is not given to see you openly; you
      might have some chance of getting married then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cardinal says that it is not in his power to give permission, as
      anyone transgressing the foundation is excommunicated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I should imagine that the founder of this house is now consumed by
      the flames of hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all think so, and hope he may stay there. The Pope ought to take some
      order with the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave her ten crowns, saying that as I could not see her I could not
      promise a second visit, and then I went away with Menicuccio, who was
      angry with himself for having procured me such a tedious hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I shall never see your mistress or your sister,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;your
      sister&rsquo;s voice went to my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think your ten paistres ought to work miracles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose there is another parlour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but only priests are allowed to enter it under pain of
      excommunication, unless you get leave from the Holy Father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not imagine how such a monstrous establishment could be tolerated,
      for it was almost impossible, under the circumstances, for the poor girls
      to get a husband. I calculated that as two hundred piastres were assigned
      to each as a dowry in case of marriage, the founder must have calculated
      on two marriages a year at least, and it seemed probable that these sums
      were made away with by some scoundrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laid my ideas before Cardinal Bernis in the presence of the princess,
      who seemed moved with compassion for these poor women, and said I must
      write out a petition and get it signed by all of them, entreating the Holy
      Father to allow them the privileges customary in all other convents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal told me to draft the supplication, to obtain the signatures,
      and to place it in the hands of the princess. In the meantime he would get
      the ear of the Holy Father, and ascertain by whose hands it was most
      proper for the petition to be presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt pretty sure of the signatures of the greater number of the
      recluses, and after writing out the petition I left it in the hands of the
      governess to whom I had spoken before. She was delighted with the idea,
      and promised to give me back the paper when I came again, with the
      signatures of all her companions in misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the Princess Santa Croce had the document she addressed herself
      to the Cardinal-Superintendent Orsini, who promised to bring the matter
      before the Pope. Cardinal Bernis had already spoken to His Holiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chaplain of the institute was ordered to warn the superior that for
      the future visitors were to be allowed to see girls in the large parlour,
      provided they were accompanied by a governess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Menicuccio brought me this news, which the princess had not heard, and
      which she was delighted to hear from my lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy Pope did not stop there. He ordered a rigid scrutiny of the
      accounts to be made, and reduced the number from a hundred to fifty,
      doubling the dower. He also ordered that all girls who reached the age of
      twenty-five without getting married should be sent away with their four
      hundred crowns apiece; that twelve discreet matrons should have charge of
      the younger girls, and that twelve servants should be paid to do the hard
      work of the house.

      These innovations were the work of some six months. The first reform was
      the abolition of the prohibition on entering the large parlour and even
      the interior of the convent; for as the inmates had taken no vows and were
      not cloistered nuns, the superior should have been at liberty to act
      according to her discretion. Menicuccio had learnt this from a note his
      sister wrote him, and which he brought to me in high glee, asking me to
      come with him to the convent, according to his sister&rsquo;s request, who said
      my presence would be acceptable to her governess. I was to ask for the
      governess.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was only too glad to lend myself to this pleasant arrangement, and felt
      curious to see the faces of the three recluses, as well as to hear what
      they had to say on these great changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got into the large parlour I saw two grates, one occupied by the
      Abbe Guasco, whom I had known in Paris in 1751, the other by a Russian
      nobleman, Ivan Ivanovitch Schuvaloff, and by Father Jacquier, a friar
      minim of the Trinita dei Monti, and a learned astronomer. Behind the grate
      I saw three very pretty girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      When our friends came down we began a very interesting conversation, which
      had to be conducted in a low tone for fear of our being overheard. We
      could not talk at our ease till the other visitors had taken their leave.
      My young friend&rsquo;s mistress was a very pretty girl, but his sister was a
      ravishing beauty. She had just entered on her sixteenth year, but she was
      tall and her figure well developed; in short, she enchanted me. I thought
      I had never seen a whiter skin or blacker hair and eyebrows and eyes, but
      still more charming was the sweetness of her voice and expression, and the
      naive simplicity of her expressions. Her governess who was ten or twelve
      years older than she was, was a woman of an extremely interesting
      expression; she was pale and melancholy looking, no doubt from the fires
      which she had been forced to quench within her. She delighted me by
      telling me of the confusion which the new regulations had caused in the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mother-superior is well pleased,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and all my young
      companions are overjoyed; but the older ones whom circumstance has made
      into bigots are scandalized at everything. The superior has already given
      orders for windows to be made in the dark parlours, though the old women
      say that she cannot go beyond the concessions she has already received. To
      this the superior answered that as free communication had been allowed, it
      would be absurd to retain the darkness. She has also given orders for the
      alteration of the double grating, as there was only a single one in the
      large parlour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought the superior must be a woman of intelligence, and expressed a
      desire to see her. Emilie obtained this pleasure for me the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emilie was the friend of Armelline, Menicuccio&rsquo;s sister. This first visit
      lasted two hours, and seemed all too short. Menicuccio spoke to his
      well-beloved at the other grating.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went away, after having given them ten Roman crowns as before. I kissed
      Armelline&rsquo;s fair hands, and as she felt the contact of my lips her face
      was suffused by a vivid blush. Never had the lips of man touched more
      dainty hands before, and she looked quite astounded at the ardour with
      which I kissed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went home full of love for her, and without heeding the obstacles in my
      path I gave reins to my passion, which seemed to me the most ardent I had
      ever experienced.
    </p>
    <p>
      My young friend was in an ocean of bliss. He had declared his love, and
      the girl had said that she would gladly become his wife if he could get
      the cardinal&rsquo;s consent. As this consent only depended on his ability to
      keep himself, I promised to give him a hundred crowns and my patronage. He
      had served his time as a tailor&rsquo;s apprentice, and was in a position to
      open a shop of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I envy your lot,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for your happiness is assured, while I, though
      I love your sister, despair of possessing her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you married then?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, yes! Keep my counsel, for I propose visiting her every day, and if
      it were known that I was married, my visits would be received with
      suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged to tell this lie to avoid the temptation of marrying her,
      and to prevent Armelline thinking that I was courting her with that
      intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the superioress a polite and clever woman, wholly free from
      prejudices. After coming down to the grate to oblige me, she sometimes
      came for her own pleasure. She knew that I was the author of the happy
      reform in the institution, and she told me that she considered herself
      under great obligations to me. In less than six weeks three of her girls
      made excellent marriages, and six hundred crowns had been added to the
      yearly income of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told me that she was ill pleased with one of their confessors. He was
      a Dominican, and made it a rule that his penitents should approach the
      holy table every Sunday and feast day; he kept them for hours in the
      confessional, and imposed penances and fastings which were likely to
      injure the health of young girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;cannot improve them from a mortal point of view,
      and takes up a lot of their time, so that they have none left for their
      work, by the sale of which they procure some small comforts for
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many confessors have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you satisfied with the other three?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they are sensible men, and do not ask too much of poor human
      nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will carry your just complaint to the cardinal; will you write out your
      petition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kindly give me a model.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave her a rough draft, which she copied out and signed, and I laid it
      before his eminence. A few days after the Dominican was removed, and his
      penitents divided amongst the three remaining confessors. The younger
      members of the community owed me a great debt of gratitude on account of
      this change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Menicuccio went to see his sweetheart every holiday, while I, in my
      amorous ardour, visited his sister every morning at nine o&rsquo;clock. I
      breakfasted with her and Emilie, and remained in the parlour till eleven.
      As there was only one grating I could lock the door behind me, but we
      could be seen from the interior of the convent, as the door was left open
      to admit light, there being no window. This was a great annoyance for me;
      recluses, young or old, were continually passing by, and none of them
      failed to give a glance in the direction of the grate; thus my fair
      Armelline could not stretch out her hand to receive my amorous kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of December the cold became intense, and I begged the
      superior to allow me to place a screen in front of the door, as I feared I
      should catch cold otherwise. The worthy woman granted my request without
      any difficulty, and we were at our ease for the future, though the desires
      with which Armelline inspired me had become dreadful torment.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 1st day of January, 1771, I presented each of them with a good
      winter dress, and sent the superior a quantity of chocolate, sugar, and
      coffee, all of which were extremely welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emilie often came by herself to the grating, as Armelline was not ready,
      and in the same way Armelline would come by herself when her governess
      happened to be busy. It was in these quarters of an hour that she
      succeeded in captivating me, heart and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emilie and Armelline were great friends, but their prejudices on the
      subject of sensual enjoyment were so strong that I could never get them to
      listen to licentious talk, to allow certain small liberties which I would
      gladly have taken, or to afford me those pleasures of the eyes that we
      accept in default of better things.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day they were petrified by my asking them whether they did not
      sometimes sleep in the same bed, so as to give each other proofs of the
      tenderness of their mutual affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      How they blushed Emilie asked me with the most perfect innocence what
      there was in common between affection and the inconvenience of sleeping
      two in a narrow bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took care not to explain myself, for I saw that I had frightened them.
      No doubt they were of the same flesh and blood as I, but our educators had
      differed widely. They had evidently never confided their little secrets to
      one another, possibly not even to their confessor, either through shame,
      or with the idea that the liberties they indulged in alone were no sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made them a present of some silk stockings, lined with plush to keep out
      the cold, and vainly endeavoured to make them try the stockings on before
      me. I might say as often as I pleased that there was no real difference
      between a man&rsquo;s legs and a woman&rsquo;s, and that their confessor would laugh
      at them if they confessed to shewing their legs. They only answered that
      girls were not allowed to take such a liberty, as they wore petticoats on
      purpose to conceal their legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manner in which Emilie spoke, always with Armelline&rsquo;s approbation,
      convinced me that their modesty was genuine. I penetrated her idea; she
      thought that in acceding to my request she would be lowering herself in my
      eyes, and that I should despise her ever after. Nevertheless Emilie was a
      woman of twenty-seven, and by no means a devotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Armelline, I could see that she took Emilie for her model, and
      would have been ashamed of appearing less precise than her friend. I
      thought she loved me, and that, contrary to the general rule, she would be
      more easily won by herself than in company with her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made the trial one morning when she appeared at the grating by herself,
      telling me that her governess was busy. I said that I adored her and was
      the most hapless of men, for being a married man I had no hope of ever
      being able to clasp her to my arms and cover her with kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I continue to live, dear Armelline, with no other consolation than
      that of kissing your fair hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words, pronounced with so much passion, she fixed her gaze on me,
      and after a few moments&rsquo; reflection she began to kiss my hands as ardently
      as I had kissed hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged her to put her mouth so that I might kiss it. She blushed and
      looked down, and did nothing. I bewailed my fate bitterly, but in vain.
      She was deaf and dumb till Emilie came and asked us why we were so dull.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time, the beginning of 1771, I was visited by Mariuccia, whom I
      had married ten years before to a young hairdresser. My readers may
      remember how I met her at Abbe Momolo&rsquo;s. During the three months I had
      been in Rome I had enquired in vain as to what had become of her; so that
      I was delighted when she made her appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you at St. Peter&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;at the midnight mass on Christmas
      Eve, but not daring to approach you because of the people with whom I was,
      I told a friend of mine to follow you and find out where you lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it that I have tried to find you out in vain for the last three
      months?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband set up at Frascati eight years ago, and we have lived there
      very happily ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to hear it. Have you any children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four; and the eldest, who is nine years old, is very like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you love her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I adore her, but I love the other three as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I wanted to go to breakfast with Armelline I begged Margarita to keep
      Mariuccia company till my return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mariuccia dined with me, and we spent a pleasant day together without
      attempting to renew our more tender relationship. We had plenty to talk
      about, and she told me that Costa, my old servant, had come back to Rome
      in a splendid coach, three years after I had left, and that he had married
      one of Momolo&rsquo;s daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a rascal; he robbed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guessed as much; his theft did him no good. He left his wife two years
      after their marriage, and no one knows what has become of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about his wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is living miserably in Rome. Her father is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not care to go and see the poor woman, for I could not do anything
      for her, and I could not have helped saying that if I caught her husband I
      would do my best to have him hanged. Such was indeed my intention up to
      the year 1785, when I found this runagate at Vienna. He was then Count
      Erdich&rsquo;s man, and when we come to that period the reader shall hear what I
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      I promised Mariuccia to come and see her in the course of Lent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess Santa Croce and the worthy Cardinal Bernis pitied me for my
      hapless love; I often confided my sufferings to their sympathizing ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal told the princess that she could very well obtain permission
      from Cardinal Orsini to take Armelline to the theatre, and that if I cared
      to join the party I might find her less cruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cardinal will make no objection,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as Armelline has taken no
      vows; but as you must know our friend&rsquo;s mistress before making your
      request, you have only to tell the cardinal that you would like to see the
      interior of the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he will give me leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; the inmates are not cloistered nuns. We will go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come too? that will be a delightful party indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask for leave, and we will arrange the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This plan seemed to me a delicious dream. I guessed that the gallant
      cardinal was curious to see Armelline, but I was not afraid as I knew he
      was a constant lover. Besides I felt sure that if he took an interest in
      the fair recluse he would be certain to find her a husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      In three or four days the princess summoned me to her box in the Alberti
      Theatre, and shewed me Cardinal Orsini&rsquo;s note, allowing her and her
      friends to see the interior of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow afternoon,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;we will fix the day and the hour for the
      visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day I paid my usual visit to the recluses, and the superioress came
      to tell me that the cardinal had told her that the Princess Santa Croce
      was coming to visit the house with some friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I am coming with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is she coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet, but I will inform you later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This novelty has turned the house upside down. The devotees scarcely know
      whether they are awake or dreaming, for with the exception of a few
      priests, the doctor, and the surgeon, no one has ever entered the house
      since its foundation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All these restrictions are now removed, and you need not ask the
      cardinal&rsquo;s permission to receive visits from your friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that, but I don&rsquo;t like to go so far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The time for the visit was fixed for the afternoon of the next day, and I
      let the superioress know early the next morning. The Duchess of Fiano had
      asked to join us; the cardinal came, of course, dressed as a simple
      priest, with no indication of his exalted rank. He knew Armelline directly
      from my description, and congratulated her on having made my acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl blushed to the roots of her hair; and I thought she would
      have fainted when the princess, after telling her she was the prettiest
      girl in the house, gave her two affectionate kisses, a mark of friendship
      strictly forbidden by the rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      After these caresses, the princess proceeded to compliment the
      superioress. She said that I had done well to praise her parts, as she
      could judge of them by the order and neatness which reigned everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall mention your name to Cardinal Orsini,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;and you may be
      sure I shall do you all the justice you deserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we had seen all the rooms, which contained nothing worth seeing, I
      presented Emilie to the princess, who received her with great cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard of your sadness,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I know the reason of it.
      You are a good girl, and pretty too, and I shall get you a husband who
      will cure you of your melancholy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The superioress gave a smile of approbation, but I saw a dozen aged
      devotees pulling wry faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emilie dared not reply, but she took the princess&rsquo;s hand and kissed it, as
      if to summon her to keep her promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for me, I was delighted to see that though all the girls were really
      pretty, my Armelline eclipsed them all, as the light of the sun obscures
      the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we came down to the parlour, the princess told Armelline that she
      meant to ask leave of the cardinal to take her two or three times to the
      theatre before Lent began. This observation seemed to petrify everyone
      except the superioress, who said that his eminence had now a perfect right
      to relax any or all of the rules of the establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Armelline was so overwhelmed between joy and confusion that she could
      not speak. She seemed unable to find words wherein to thank the princess,
      who commended her and her friend Emilie to the superioress before she left
      the house, and gave her a small present to buy necessaries for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not to be outdone, the Duchess of Fiano told the superioress that she
      would make me the almoner of her bounty towards Armelline and Emilie. My
      expressions of gratitude to the princess when we were back in the carriage
      may be imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no need to excuse Armelline, for the princess and the cardinal had
      gauged her capacities. Her confusion had prevented her shewing her
      cleverness, but her face shewed her to possess it. Besides, the influence
      of the education she had received had to be taken into account. The
      princess was impatient to take her to the theatre, and afterwards to
      supper at an inn, according to the Roman custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote the names of Armelline and Emilie upon her tablets, so as to
      remember them on every occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not forget the mistress of my poor friend Menicuccio, but the time
      was not opportune for mentioning her name. The next day, however, I got
      the cardinal&rsquo;s ear, and told him that I was anxious to do something for
      the young man. The cardinal saw him, and Menicuccio pleased him so well
      that the marriage took place before the end of the carnival, the bride
      having a dowry of five hundred crowns. With this sum and the hundred
      crowns I gave him, he was in a position to open a shop for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after the princess&rsquo;s visit was a triumphant one for me. As soon as
      I appeared at the grating the superioress was sent for, and we had an
      interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess had given her fifty crowns, which she was going to lay out on
      linen for Armelline and Emilie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recluses were stupefied when I told them that the fat priest was
      Cardinal Bernis, as they had an idea that a cardinal can never doff the
      purple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess of Fiano had sent a cask of wine, which was an unknown
      beverage there, and these presents made them hope for others. I was looked
      upon as the bringer of all this good luck, and gratitude shewed itself so
      plainly in every word and glance that I felt I might hope for everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later, the princess told Cardinal Orsini that she had taken a
      peculiar interest in two of the young recluses, and desiring to provide
      them with suitable establishments she wished to take them now and again to
      the theatre so as to give them some knowledge of the world. She undertook
      to take them and bring them back herself or only to confide them to sure
      hands. The cardinal replied that the superioress should receive
      instructions to oblige her in every particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I heard of this from the princess, I said that I would
      ascertain what orders had been actually received at the convent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the superioress told me that his eminence had instructed her
      to do what she thought best for the welfare of the young people committed
      to her charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have also received orders,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;to send in the names of those
      who have attained the age of thirty, and wish to leave the convent, that
      they may receive a warrant for their two hundred crowns. I have not yet
      published this command, but I haven&rsquo;t the slightest doubt that we shall
      get rid of a score at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told the princess of the cardinal&rsquo;s orders, and she agreed with me that
      his behaviour was most generous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cardinal Bernis, who was by, advised her that the first time she took the
      girls to the theatre she had better go in person, and tell the superioress
      that she would always send her carriage and liveried servants to fetch
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess approved of this advice, and a few days later she called for
      Emilie and Armelline, and brought them to her palace, where I awaited them
      with the cardinal, the prince, and the Duchess of Fiano.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were welcomed warmly, encouraged to reply, to laugh, and to say what
      was in their minds, but all in vain; finding themselves for the first time
      in a splendid apartment surrounded by brilliant company, they were so
      confounded that they could not say a word. Emilie persisted in rising from
      her seat whenever she was addressed, and Armelline shone only by her
      beauty and the vivid blush which suffused her face whenever she was
      addressed. The princess might kiss her as much as she pleased, but the
      novice had not the courage to return her kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Armelline mustered up courage to take the princess&rsquo;s hand and kiss
      it, but when the lady kissed her on the lips the girl remained inactive,
      seeming to be absolutely ignorant of such a natural and easy matter as the
      returning of a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal and the prince laughed; the duchess said that so much
      restraint was unnatural. As for me I was on thorns, such awkwardness
      seemed to me near akin to stupidity, for Armelline had only to do to the
      princess&rsquo;s lips what she had already done to her hand. No doubt she
      fancied that to do to the princess what the princess had done to her would
      shew too much familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal took me on one side and said he could not believe that I had
      not initiated her in the course of two months&rsquo; intimacy, but I pointed out
      to him the immense force of long engrained prejudice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far this first tine the princess had made up her mind to take them to the
      Torre di Nonna Theatre, as comic pieces were played there, and they could
      not help but laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the play we went to sup at an inn, and at table the good cheer and
      my exhortations began to take some effect on her. We persuaded them to
      drink a little wine, and their spirits improved visibly. Emilie ceased to
      be sad, and Armelline gave the princess some real kisses. We applauded
      their efforts to be gay and our applause convinced them that they had done
      nothing wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the princess charged me with the pleasant trust of taking the
      two guests back to the convent. Now, I thought, my time has come; but when
      we were in the carriage I saw that I had reckoned without my host. When I
      would have kissed, heads were turned aside; when I would have stretched
      forth an indiscreet hand, dresses were wrapped more tightly; when I would
      have forced my way, I was resisted by force; when I complained, I was told
      that I was in the wrong; when I got in a rage, I was allowed to say on;
      and when I threatened to see them no more, they did not believe me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got to the convent a servant opened the side door, and noticing
      that she did not shut it after the girls, I went in too, and went with
      them to see the superioress, who was in bed, and did not seem at all
      astonished to see me. I told her that I considered it my duty to bring
      back her young charges in person. She thanked me, asked them if they had
      had a pleasant evening, and bade me good night, begging me to make as
      little noise as possible on my way downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wished them all happy slumbers, and after giving a sequin to the servant
      who opened the door, and another to the coachman, I had myself set down at
      the door of my lodging. Margarita was asleep on a sofa and welcomed me
      with abuse, but she soon found out by the ardour of my caresses that I had
      not been guilty of infidelity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not get up till noon, and at three o&rsquo;clock I called on the princess
      and found the cardinal already there.
    </p>
    <p>
      They expected to hear the story of my triumph, but the tale I told and my
      apparent indifference in the matter came as a surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may as well confess that my face was by no means the index of my mind.
      However, I did my best to give the thing a comic turn, saying that I did
      not care for Pamelas, and that I had made up my mind to give up the
      adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said the cardinal, &ldquo;I shall take two or three days
      before I congratulate you on your self-restraint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His knowledge of the human heart was very extensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armelline thought I must have slept till late as she did not see me in the
      morning as usual; but when the second day went by without my coming she
      sent her brother to ask if I were ill, for I had never let two days pass
      without paying her a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Menicuccio came accordingly, and was delighted to find me in perfect
      health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and tell your sister,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that I shall continue to interest the
      princess on her behalf, but that I shall see her no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I wish to cure myself of an unhappy passion. Your sister does not
      love me: I am sure of it. I am no longer a young man, and I don&rsquo;t feel
      inclined to become a martyr to her virtue. Virtue goes rather too far when
      it prevents a girl giving the man who adores her a single kiss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I would not have believed that of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless it is the fact, and I must make an end of it. Your sister
      cannot understand the danger she runs in treating a lover in this fashion.
      Tell her all that, my dear Menicuccio, but don&rsquo;t give her any advice of
      your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t think how grieved I am to hear all this; perhaps it&rsquo;s Emilie&rsquo;s
      presence that makes her so cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have often pressed her when we have been alone together, but all in
      vain. I want to cure myself, for if she does not love me I do not wish to
      obtain her either by seduction or by any feeling of gratitude on her part.
      Tell me how your future bride treats you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, ever since she has been sure of my marrying her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt sorry then that I had given myself out as a married man, for in my
      state of irritation I could even have given her a promise of marriage
      without deliberately intending to deceive her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Menicuccio went on his way distressed, and I went to the meeting of the
      &ldquo;Arcadians,&rdquo; at the Capitol, to hear the Marchioness d&rsquo;Aout recite her
      reception piece. This marchioness was a young Frenchwoman who had been at
      Rome for the last six months with her husband, a man of many talents, but
      inferior to her, for she was a genius. From this day I became her intimate
      friend, but without the slightest idea of an intrigue, leaving all that to
      a French priest who was hopelessly in love with her, and had thrown up his
      chances of preferment for her sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day the Princess Santa Croce told me that I could have the key to
      her box at the theatre whenever I liked to take Armelline and Emilie, but
      when a week passed by without my giving any sign she began to believe that
      I had really broken off the connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal, on the other hand, believed me to be still in love, and
      praised my conduct. He told me that I should have a letter from the
      superioress, and he was right; for at the end of the week she wrote me a
      polite note begging me to call on her, which I was obliged to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      I called on her, and she began by asking me plainly why my visits had
      ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am in love with Armelline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that reason brought you here every day, I do not see how it can have
      suddenly operated in another direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet it is all quite natural; for when one loves one desires, and when
      one desires in vain one suffers, and continual suffering is great
      unhappiness. And so you see that I am bound to act thus for my own sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pity you, and see the wisdom of your course; but allow me to tell you
      that, esteeming Armelline, you have no right to lay her open to a judgment
      being passed upon her which is very far from the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what judgment is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That your love was only a whim, and that as soon as it was satisfied you
      abandoned her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry indeed to hear of this, but what can I do? I must cure myself
      of this unhappy passion. Do you know any other remedy than absence? Kindly
      advise me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about the affection called love, but it seems to me
      that by slow degrees love becomes friendship, and peace is restored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, but if it is to become friendship, love must be gently treated. If
      the beloved object is not very tender, love grows desperate and turns to
      indifference or contempt. I neither wish to grow desperate nor to despise
      Armelline, who is a miracle of beauty and goodness. I shall do my utmost
      for her, just as if she had made me happy, but I will see her no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in complete darkness on the matter. They assure me that they have
      never failed in their duty towards you, and that they cannot imagine why
      you have ceased coming here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether by prudence, or timidity, or a delicate wish not to say anything
      against me, they have told you a lie; but you deserve to know all, and my
      honour requires that I should tell you the whole story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please do so; you may count on my discretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I then told my tale, and I saw she was moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always tried,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;never to believe evil except on
      compulsion, nevertheless, knowing as I do the weakness of the human heart,
      I could never have believed that throughout so long and intimate an
      acquaintance you could have kept yourself so severely within bounds. In my
      opinion there would be much less harm in a kiss than in all this scandal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure that Armelline does not care about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does nothing but weep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her tears probably spring from vanity, or from the cause her companions
      assign for my absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have told them all that you are ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does Emilie say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does not weep, but she looks sad, and says over and over again that
      it is not her fault if you do not come, thereby hinting that it is
      Armelline&rsquo;s fault. Come tomorrow to oblige me. They are dying to see the
      opera at the Aliberti, and the comic opera at the Capronica.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, then I will breakfast with them to-morrow morning, and
      to-morrow evening they shall see the opera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good; I thank you. Shall I tell them the news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please tell Armelline that I am only coming after hearing all that you
      have said to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The princess skipped for joy when she heard of my interview with the
      superioress, and the cardinal said he had guessed as much. The princess
      gave me the key of her box, and ordered that her carriage and servants
      should be at my orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day when I went to the convent Emilie came down by herself to
      reproach me on my cruel conduct. She told me that a man who really loved
      would not have acted in such a manner, and that I had been wrong to tell
      the superioress everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not have said anything if I had had anything important to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Armelline has become unhappy through knowing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she does not want to fail in her duty, and she sees that you only
      love her to turn her from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But her unhappiness will cease when I cease troubling her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean you are not going to see her any more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Do you think that it costs me no pain? But I must make the
      effort for the sake of my peace of mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she will be sure that you do not love her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must think what she pleases. In the meanwhile I feel sure that if she
      loved me as I loved her, we should be of one mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have duties which seem to press lightly on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then be faithful to your duties, and permit a man of honour to respect
      them by visiting you no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armelline then appeared. I thought her changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you look so grave and pale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you have grieved me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come then, be gay once more, and allow me to cure myself of a passion,
      the essence of which is to induce you to fail in your duty. I shall be
      still your friend, and I shall come to see you once a week while I remain
      in Rome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once a week! You needn&rsquo;t have begun by coming once a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right; it was your kind expression which deceived me, but I hope
      you will allow me to become rational again. For this to happen, I must try
      not to see you more than I can help. Think over it, and you will see that
      I am doing all for the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard that you can&rsquo;t love me as I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean calmly, and without desires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that; but holding your desires in check, if they are contrary
      to the voice of duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too old to learn this method, and it does not seem to me an
      attractive one. Kindly tell me whether the restraint of your desires gives
      you much pain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t repress my desires when I think of you, I cherish them; I wish
      you were the Pope, I wish you were my father, that I might caress you in
      all innocence; in my dreams I wish you could become a girl, so that we
      might always live happily together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this true touch of native simplicity, I could not help smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told them that I should come in the evening to take them to the
      Aliberti, and felt in a better humour after my visit, for I could see that
      there was no art or coquetry in what Armelline said. I saw that she loved
      me, but would not come to a parley with her love, hence her repugnance to
      granting me her favours; if she once did so, her eyes would be opened. All
      this was pure nature, for experience had not yet taught her that she ought
      either to avoid me or to succumb to my affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening I called for the two friends to take them to the opera, and
      I had not long to wait. I was by myself in the carriage, but they evinced
      no surprise. Emilie conveyed to me the compliments of the superioress, who
      would be obliged by my calling on her the following day. At the opera I
      let them gaze at the spectacle which they saw for the first time, and
      answered whatever questions they put to me. As they were Romans, they
      ought to have known what a castrato was, nevertheless, Armelline took the
      wretched individual who sang the prima donna&rsquo;s part for a woman, and
      pointed to his breast, which was really a fine one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you dare to sleep in the same bed with him?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; an honest girl ought always to sleep by herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was the severity of the education they had received. Everything
      connected with love was made a mystery of, and treated with a kind of
      superstitious awe. Thus Armelline had only let me kiss her hands after a
      long contest, and neither she nor Emilie would allow me to see whether the
      stockings I had given them fitted well or not. The severe prohibition that
      was laid on sleeping with another girl must have made them think that to
      shew their nakedness to a companion would be a great sin, and let a man
      see their beauties a hideous crime. The very idea of such a thing must
      have given them a shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever I had attempted to indulge in conversation which was a little
      free, I had found them deaf and dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Emilie was a handsome girl in spite of her pallor, I did not take
      sufficient interest in her to try to dissipate her melancholy; but loving
      Armelline to desperation I was cut to the quick to see her look grave when
      I asked her if she had any idea of the difference between the physical
      conformation of men and women.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we were leaving Armelline said she was hungry, as she had scarcely
      eaten anything for the last week on account of the grief I had given her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had foreseen that,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I would have ordered a good supper,
      whereas I have now only potluck to offer you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. How many shall we be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better; we shall be more at liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t like the princess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, but she wants me to kiss her in a way I don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, you kissed her ardently enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid she would take me for a simpleton if I did not do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do you think you committed a sin in kissing her like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, for it was very unpleasant for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why won&rsquo;t you make the same effort on my behalf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing, and when we got to the inn I ordered them to light a
      fire and to get a good supper ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter asked me if I would like some oysters, and noticing the
      curiosity of my guests on the subject I asked him how much they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are from the arsenal at Venice,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and we can&rsquo;t sell them
      under fifty pains a hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, I will take a hundred, but you must open them here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armelline was horrified to think that I was going to pay five crowns for
      her whim, and begged me to revoke the order; but she said nothing when I
      told her that no pleasure of hers could be bought too dearly by me.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this she took my hand and would have carried it to her lips, but I took
      it away rather roughly, greatly to her mortification.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sitting in front of the fire between them, and I was sorry at having
      grieved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon, Armelline,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I only took my hand away because it
      was not worthy of being carried to your fair lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of this excuse she could not help two big tears coursing down her
      blushing cheeks. I was greatly pained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armelline was a tender dove, not made to be roughly treated. If I did not
      want her to hate me I felt that I must either not see her at all or treat
      her more gently for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tears convinced me that I had wounded her feelings terribly, and I got
      up and went out to order some champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came back I found that she had been weeping bitterly. I did not
      know what to do; I begged her again and again to forgive me, and to be gay
      once more, unless she wished to subject me to the severest of all
      punishments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emilie backed me up, and on taking her hand and covering it with kisses, I
      had the pleasure of seeing her smile once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oysters were opened in our presence, and the astonishment depicted on
      the girls&rsquo; countenances would have amused me if my heart had been more at
      ease. But I was desperate with love, and Armelline begged me vainly to be
      as I was when we first met.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat down, and I taught my guests how to suck up the oysters, which swam
      in their own liquid, and were very good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armelline swallowed half a dozen, and then observed to her friend that so
      delicate a morsel must be a sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on account of its delicacy,&rdquo; said Emilie, &ldquo;but because at every
      mouthful we swallow half a paulo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half a paolo&rdquo; said Armelline, &ldquo;and the Holy Father does not forbid such a
      luxury? If this is not the sin of gluttony, I don&rsquo;t know what is. These
      oysters are delightful; but I shall speak about the matter to my
      director.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These simplicities of hers afforded me great mental pleasure, but I wanted
      bodily pleasure as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      We ate fifty oysters, and drank two bottles of sparkling champagne, which
      made my two guests eruct and blush and laugh at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would fain have laughed too and devoured Armelline with my kisses, but I
      could only devour her with by eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I kept the remainder of the oysters for dessert, and ordered the supper to
      be served. It was an excellent meal, and the two heroines enjoyed it; even
      Emilie became quite lively.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ordered up lemons and a bottle of rum, and after having the fifty
      remaining oysters opened I sent the waiter away. I then made a bowl of
      punch, pouring in a bottle of champagne as a finishing touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      After they had swallowed a few oysters and drank one or two glasses of
      punch, which they liked amazingly, I begged Emilie to give me an oyster
      with her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you are too sensible to find anything wrong in that,&rdquo; I added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emilie was astonished at the proposition, and thought it over. Armelline
      gazed at her anxiously, as if curious as to how she would answer me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask Armelline?&rdquo; she said at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you give him one first,&rdquo; said Armelline, &ldquo;and if you have the courage
      I will try to do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What courage do you want? It&rsquo;s a child&rsquo;s game; there&rsquo;s no harm in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this reply, I was sure of victory. I placed the shell on the edge of
      her lips, and after a good deal of laughing she sucked in the oyster,
      which she held between her lips. I instantly recovered it by placing my
      lips on hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armelline clapped her hands, telling Emilie that she would never have
      thought her so brave; she then imitated her example, and was delighted
      with my delicacy in sucking away the oyster, scarcely touching her lips
      with mine. My agreeable surprise may be imagined when I heard her say that
      it was my turn to hold the oysters. It is needless to say that I acquitted
      myself of the duty with much delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      After these pleasant interludes we went to drinking punch and swallowing
      oysters.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all sat in a row with our backs to the fire, and our brains began to
      whirl, but never was there such a sweet intoxication. However, the punch
      was not finished and we were getting very hot. I took off my coat, and
      they were obliged to unlace their dresses, the bodices of which were lined
      with fur. Guessing at necessities which they did not dare to mention, I
      pointed out a closet where they could make themselves comfortable, and
      they went in hand-in-hand. When they came out they were no longer timid
      recluses, they were shrieking with laughter, and reeling from side to
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was their screen as we sat in front of the fire, and I gazed freely on
      charms which they could no longer conceal. I told them that we must not
      think of going till the punch was finished, and they agreed, saying, in
      high glee, that it would be a great sin to leave so good a thing behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then presumed so far as to tell them that they had beautiful legs, and
      that I should be puzzled to assign the prize between them. This made them
      gayer than ever, for they had not noticed that their unlaced bodices and
      short petticoats let me see almost everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      After drinking our punch to the dregs, we remained talking for half an
      hour, while I congratulated myself on my self-restraint. Just as we were
      going I asked them if they had any grounds of complaint against me.
      Armelline replied that if I would adopt her as my daughter she was ready
      to follow me to the end of the world. &ldquo;Then you are not afraid of my
      turning you from the path of duty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I feel quite safe with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you say, dear Emilie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall love you too, when you do for me what the superioress will tell
      you to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do anything, but I shan&rsquo;t come to speak to her till the evening,
      for it is three o&rsquo;clock now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They laughed all the louder, exclaiming,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will the mother say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I paid the bill, gave something to the waiter, and took them back to the
      convent, where the porteress seemed well enough pleased with the new rules
      when she saw two sequins in her palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too late to see the superioress, so I drove home after rewarding
      the coachman and the lackey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margarita was ready to scratch my eyes out if I could not prove my
      fidelity, but I satisfied her by quenching on her the fires Armelline and
      the punch had kindled. I told her I had been kept by a gaming party, and
      she asked no more questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I amused the princess and the cardinal by a circumstantial
      account of what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You missed your opportunity,&rdquo; said the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said the cardinal, &ldquo;I believe, on the contrary, that
      he has made his victory more sure for another time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, I went to the convent where the superioress gave me her
      warmest welcome. She complimented me on having amused myself with the two
      girls till three o&rsquo;clock in the morning without doing anything wrong. They
      had told her how we had eaten the oysters, and she said it was an amusing
      idea. I admired her candour, simplicity, or philosophy, whichever you like
      to call it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After these preliminaries, she told me that I could make Emilie happy by
      obtaining, through the influence of the princess, a dispensation to marry
      without the publication of banns a merchant of Civita Vecchia, who would
      have married her long ago only that there was a woman who pretended to
      have claims upon him. If banns were published this woman would institute a
      suit which might go on forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do this,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;you will have the merit of making Emilie
      happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took down the man&rsquo;s name, and promised to do my best with the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you still determined to cure yourself of your love for Armelline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I shall not begin the cure till Lent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you; the carnival is unusually long this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day I spoke of the matter to the princess. The first requisite
      was a certificate from the Bishop of Civita Vecchia, stating that the man
      was free to marry. The cardinal said that the man must come to Rome, and
      that the affair could be managed if he could bring forward two good
      witnesses who would swear that he was unmarried.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told the superioress what the cardinal said, and she wrote to the
      merchant, and a few days after I saw him talking to the superioress and
      Emilie through the grating.
    </p>
    <p>
      He commended himself to my protection, and said that before he married he
      wanted to be sure of having six hundred crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The convent would give him four hundred crowns, so we should have to
      obtain a grant of two hundred more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I succeeded in getting the grant, but I first contrived to have another
      supper with Armelline, who asked me every morning when I was going to take
      her to the comic opera. I said I was afraid of turning her astray from the
      path of duty, but she replied that experience had taught her to dread me
      no longer.

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The Florentine&mdash;Marriage of Emilie&mdash;Scholastica&mdash;Armelline
     at the Ball
</pre>
    <p>
      Before the supper I had loved Armelline to such an extent that I had
      determined to see her no more, but after it I felt that I must obtain her
      or die. I saw that she had only consented to my small liberties because
      she regarded them as mere jokes, of no account, and I resolved to take
      advantage of this way of looking at it to go as far as I could. I began to
      play the part of indifferent to the best of my ability, only visiting her
      every other day, and looking at her with an expression of polite interest.
      I often pretended to forget to kiss her hand, while I kissed Emilie&rsquo;s and
      told her that if I felt certain of receiving positive marks of her
      affection I should stay at Civita Vecchia for some weeks after she was
      married. I would not see Armelline&rsquo;s horror, who could not bear me to take
      a fancy to Emilie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emilie said that she would be more at liberty when she was married, while
      Armelline, vexed at her giving me any hopes, told her sharply that a
      married woman had stricter duties to perform than a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      I agreed with her in my heart, but as it would not have suited my purpose
      to say so openly I insinuated the false doctrine that a married woman&rsquo;s
      chief duty is to keep her husband&rsquo;s descent intact, and that everything
      else is of trifling importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the idea of driving Emilie to an extremity I told Emilie that if she
      wanted me to exert myself to my utmost for her she must give me good hopes
      of obtaining her favours not only after but before marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give you no other favours.&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;than those which
      Armelline may give you. You ought to try to get her married also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her grief at these proposals, gentle Armelline replied,&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the only man I have ever seen; and as I have no hopes of getting
      married I will give you no pledges at all, though I do not know what you
      mean by the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though I saw how pure and angelic she was, I had the cruelty to go away,
      leaving her to her distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hard for me to torment her thus, but I thought it was the only way
      to overcome her prejudices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calling on the Venetian ambassador&rsquo;s steward I saw some peculiarly fine
      oysters, and I got him to let me have a hundred. I then took a box at the
      Capronica Theatre, and ordered a good supper at the inn where we had
      supped before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a room with a bed,&rdquo; I said to the waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not allowed in Rome, signor,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but on the third floor
      we have two rooms with large sofas which might do instead, without the
      Holy Office being able to say anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at the rooms and took them, and ordered the man to get the best
      supper that Rome could offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was entering the box with the two girls I saw the Marchioness d&rsquo;Aout
      was my near neighbour. She accosted me, and congratulated herself on her
      vicinity to me. She was accompanied by her French abbe, her husband, and a
      fine-looking young man, whom I had never seen before. She asked who my
      companions were, and I told her they were in the Venetian ambassador&rsquo;s
      household. She praised their beauty and began to talk to Armelline, who
      answered well enough till the curtain went up. The young man also
      complimented her, and after having asked my permission he gave her a large
      packet of bonbons, telling her to share them with her neighbour. I had
      guessed him to be a Florentine from his accent, and asked him if the
      sweets came from the banks of the Arno; he told me they were from Naples,
      whence he had just arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the first act I was surprised to hear him say that he had a
      letter of introduction for me from the Marchioness of C&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just heard your name,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and tomorrow I shall have the
      honour of delivering the letter in person, if you will kindly give me your
      address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After these polite preliminaries I felt that I must comply with his
      request.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked after the marquis, his mother-in-law, and Anastasia, saying that I
      was delighted to hear from the marchioness from whom I had been expecting
      an answer for the last month.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The charming marchioness has deigned to entrust me with the answer you
      speak of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I long to read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I may give you the letter now, though I shall still claim the
      privilege of calling on you to-morrow. I will bring it to you in your box,
      if you will allow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He might easily have given it to me from the box where he was, but this
      would not have suited his plans. He came in, and politeness obliged me to
      give him my place next to Armelline. He took out an elaborate pocket-book,
      and gave me the letter. I opened it, but finding that it covered four
      pages, I said I would read it when I got home, as the box was dark. &ldquo;I
      shall stay in Rome till Easter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as I want to see all the
      sights; though indeed I cannot hope to see anything more beautiful than
      the vision now before me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armelline, who was gazing fixedly at him, blushed deeply. I felt that his
      compliment, though polite, was entirely out of place, and in some sort an
      insult to myself. However, I said nothing, but decided mentally that the
      Florentine Adonis must be a fop of the first water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding his compliment created a silence, he saw he had made himself
      offensive, and after a few disconnected remarks withdrew from the box. In
      spite of myself the man annoyed me, and I congratulated Armelline on the
      rapidity of her conquest, asking her what she thought of him. &ldquo;He is a
      fine man, but his compliments shews he has no taste. Tell me, is it the
      custom for people of fashion to make a young girl blush the first time
      they see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear Armelline, it is neither customary nor polite; and anyone who
      wishes to mix in good society would never do such a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I lapsed into silence, as though I wanted to listen to the music; but as a
      matter of fact my heart was a prey to cruel jealousy. I thought the matter
      over, and came to the conclusion that the Florentine had treated me
      rudely. He might have guessed that I was in love with Armelline, and to
      make such an open declaration of love to my very face was nothing more nor
      less than an insult to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I had kept this unusual silence for a quarter of an hour the simple
      Armelline made me worse by saying that I must calm myself, as I might be
      sure that the young man&rsquo;s compliment had not given her the slightest
      pleasure. She did not see that by saying this she made me feel that the
      compliment had had the directly opposite effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said that I had hoped he had pleased her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To finish the matter up, she said by way of soothing me that the young man
      did not mean to vex me, as he doubtless took me for her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could I reply to this observation, as cruel as it was reasonable?
      Nothing; I could only take refuge in silence and a fit of childish
      ill-humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I could bear it no longer, and begged the two girls to come away
      with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second act was just over, and if I had been in my right senses I
      should never have made them such an unreasonable request; but the
      crassness of my proceedings did not strike me till the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the strangeness of my request they merely exchanged glances
      and got ready to go. Not knowing what better excuse to give I told them I
      did not want the princess&rsquo;s carriage to be noticed as everyone left the
      theatre, and that I would bring them again to the theatre the following
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would not let Armelline put her head inside the Marchioness d&rsquo;Aout&rsquo;s
      box, and so we went out. I found the man who accompanied the carriage
      talking to one of his mates at the door of the theatre, and this made me
      think that the princess had come to the opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got down at the inn, and I whispered to the man to take his horses home
      and to call for us at three o&rsquo;clock; for the cold was intense, and both
      horses and men had to be considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      We began by sitting down in front of a roaring fire, and for half an hour
      we did nothing but eat oysters, which were opened in our presence by a
      clever waiter, who took care not to lose a drop of the fluid. As quick as
      he opened we ate, and the laughter of the girls, who talked of how we had
      eaten them before, caused my anger to gradually disappear.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Armelline&rsquo;s gentleness I saw the goodness of her heart, and I was angry
      with myself for my absurd jealousy of a man who was much more calculated
      to please a young girl than I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armelline drank champagne, and stole occasional glances in my direction as
      if to entreat me to join them in their mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emilie spoke of her marriage, and without saying anything about my
      projected visit to Civita Vecchia I promised that her future husband
      should have his plenary dispensation before very long. While I spoke I
      kissed Armelline&rsquo;s fair hands, and she looked at me as if thankful for the
      return of my affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oysters and champagne had their natural effect, and we had a
      delightful supper. We had sturgeon and some delicious truffles, which I
      enjoyed not so much for my own sake as for the pleasure with which my
      companions devoured them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man in love is provided with a kind of instinct which tells him that the
      surest way to success is to provide the beloved object with pleasures that
      are new to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Armelline saw me become gay and ardent once more she recognized her
      handiwork, and was doubtless proud of the power she exercised over me. She
      took my hand of her own accord, and continued gazing into my eyes. Emilie
      was occupied in the enjoyment of the meal, and did not trouble herself
      about our behaviour. Armelline was so tender and loving that I made sure
      of victory after we had had some more oysters and a bowl of punch.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the dessert, the fifty oysters, and all the materials for making the
      punch were on the table, the waiter left the room, saying that the ladies
      would find every requisite in the neighbouring apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was small, and the fire very hot, and I bade the two friends
      arrange their dress more comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their dresses fitted their figures, and were trimmed with fur and
      stiffened with whalebones, so they went into the next room, and came back
      in white bodices and short dimity petticoats, laughing at the slightness
      of their attire.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had sufficient strength of mind to conceal my emotion, and even not to
      look at their breasts when they complained of having no neckerchiefs or
      breast-bands to their chemises. I knew how inexperienced they were, and
      felt certain that when they saw the indifference with which I took their
      slight attire they themselves would think it was of no consequence.
      Armelline and Emilie had both beautiful breasts, and knew it; they were
      therefore astonished at my indifference, perhaps thought that I had never
      seen a fine breast. As a matter of fact a fine figure is much more scarce
      at Rome than a pretty face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, in spite of their modesty, their vanity impelled them to shew me
      that my indifference was ill-placed, but it was my part to put them at
      their ease, and to make them fling shame to the winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were enchanted when I told them to try their hands at a bowl of
      punch, and they simply danced for joy when I pronounced it better than my
      own brew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the oyster-game, and I scolded Armelline for having swallowed
      the liquid as I was taking the oyster from her lips. I agreed that it was
      very hard to avoid doing so, but I offered to shew them how it could be
      done by placing the tongue in the way. This gave me an opportunity of
      teaching them the game of tongues, which I shall not explain because it is
      well known to all true lovers. Armelline played her part with such evident
      relish that I could see she enjoyed it as well as I, though she agreed it
      was a very innocent amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so chanced that a fine oyster slipped from its shell as I was placing
      it between Emilie&rsquo;s lips. It fell on to her breast, and she would have
      recovered it with her fingers; but I claimed the right of regaining it
      myself, and she had to unlace her bodice to let me do so. I got hold of
      the oyster with my lips, but did so in such a manner as to prevent her
      suspecting that I had taken any extraordinary pleasure in the act.
      Armelline looked on without laughing; she was evidently surprised at the
      little interest I had taken in what was before my eye. Emilie laughed and
      relaced her bodice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opportunity was too good to be lost, so taking Armelline on my knee I
      gave her an oyster and let it slip as Emilie&rsquo;s had slipped, much to the
      delight of the elder, who wanted to see how her young companion would go
      through the ordeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armelline was really as much delighted herself, though she tried to
      conceal her pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want my oyster,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no need to tell me twice. I unlaced her corset in such a way as
      to make it fall still lower, bewailing the necessity of having to search
      for it with my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a martyrdom for an amorous man to have to conceal his bliss at such a
      moment!
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not let Armelline have any occasion to accuse me of taking too much
      licence, for I only touched her alabaster spheres so much as was
      absolutely necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had got the oyster again I could restrain myself no more, and
      affixing my lips to one of the blossoms of her breast I sucked it with a
      voluptuous pleasure which is beyond all description.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was astonished, but evidently moved, and I did not leave her till my
      enjoyment was complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she marked my dreamy langourous gaze, she asked me it it had given me
      much pleasure to play the part of an infant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dearest,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s only an innocent jest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so; and I hope you will say nothing about it to the
      superioress. It may be innocent for you, but it is not for me, as I
      experienced sensations which must partake of the nature of sin. We will
      pick up no more oysters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are mere trifles,&rdquo; said Emilie, &ldquo;the stain of which will easily be
      wiped out with a little holy water. At all events we can swear that there
      has been no kissing between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went into the next room for a moment, I did the same, and we then sat
      on the sofa before the fire. As I sat between them I observed that our
      legs were perfectly alike, and that I could not imagine why women stuck so
      obstinately to their petticoats.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I talked I touched their legs, saying it was just as if I were to
      touch my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not interrupt this examination which I carried up to the knee,
      and I told Emilie that all the reward I would ask for my services was that
      I might see her thighs, to compare them with Armelline&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will be bigger than I,&rdquo; said Armelline, &ldquo;though I am the taller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there would be no harm in letting me see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will feel with my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you would look at the same time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear I will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me bandage your eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; but I will bandage yours too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we will play, at blindman&rsquo;s buff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the bandaging began I took care to make them swallow a good dose of
      punch, and, then we proceeded to play. The two girls let me span their
      thighs several times, laughing and falling over me whenever my hands went
      too high.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lifted the bandage and saw everything, but they pretended not to suspect
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      They treated me in the same way, no doubt to see what it was that they
      felt when they fell upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      This delightful game went on; till exhausted, nature would not allow me to
      play it any more. I put myself in a state of decency, and then told them
      to take off their bandages.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did so and sat beside me, thinking, perhaps, that they would be able
      to, disavow everything on the score of the bandage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to me that Emilie had had a lover, though I took good care not
      to tell her so; but Armelline was a pure virgin. She was meeker than her
      friend, and her great eyes shone as voluptuously but more modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would have snatched a kiss from her pretty mouth, but she turned away
      her head, though she squeezed my hands tenderly. I was astonished at this
      refusal after the liberties I had taken with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had talked about balls, and they were both extremely anxious to see
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The public ball was the rage with all the young Romans. For ten long years
      the Pope Rezzonico had deprived them of this pleasure. Although Rezzonico
      forbade dancing, he allowed gaming of every description. Ganganelli, his
      successor, had other views, and forbade gaming but allowed dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for papal infallibility; what one condemns the other approves.
      Ganganelli thought it better to let his subjects skip than to give them
      the opportunity of ruining themselves, of committing suicide, or of
      becoming brigands; but Rezzonico did not see the matter in that light. I
      promised the girls I would take them to the ball as soon as I could
      discover one where I was not likely to be recognized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three o&rsquo;clock struck, and I took them back to the convent, well enough
      pleased with the progress I had made, though I had only increased my
      passion. I was surer than ever that Armelline was born to exercise an
      irresistible sway over every man who owed fealty to beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was amongst her liegemen, and am so still, but the incense is all gone
      and the censer of no value.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not help reflecting on the sort of glamour which made me fall in
      love with one who seemed all new to me, while I loved her in exactly the
      same manner as I had loved her predecessor. But in reality there was no
      real novelty; the piece was the same, though the title might be altered.
      But when I had won what I coveted, did I realize that I was going over old
      ground? Did I complain? Did I think myself deceived?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not one whit; and doubtless for this reason, that whilst I enjoyed the
      piece I kept my eyes fixed on the title which had so taken my fancy. If
      this be so, of what use is title at all? The title of a book, the name of
      a dish, the name of a town&mdash;of what consequence are all these when
      what one wants is to read the book, to eat the dish, and to see the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comparison is a sophism. Man becomes amorous through the senses,
      which, touch excepted, all reside in the head. In love a beautiful face is
      a matter of the greatest moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A beautiful female body might well excite a man to carnal indulgence, even
      though the head were covered, but never to real love. If at the moment of
      physical delight the covering were taken away, and a face of hideous,
      revolting ugliness disclosed, one would fly in horror, in spite of the
      beauties of the woman&rsquo;s body.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the contrary does not hold good. If a man has fallen in love with a
      sweet, enchanting face, and succeeds in lifting the veil of the sanctuary
      only to find deformities there, still the face wins the day, atones for
      all, and the sacrifice is consummated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face is thus paramount, and hence it has come to be agreed that
      women&rsquo;s bodies shall be covered and their faces disclosed; while men&rsquo;s
      clothes are arranged in such a way that women can easily guess at what
      they cannot see.
    </p>
    <p>
      This arrangement is undoubtedly to the advantage of women; art can conceal
      the imperfections of the face, and even make it appear beautiful, but no
      cosmetic can dissemble an ugly breast, stomach, or any other part of the
      man body.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of this, I confess that the phenomerides of Sparta were in the
      right, like all women who, though they possess a fine figure, have a
      repulsive face; in spite of the beauty of the piece, the title drives
      spectators away. Still an interesting face is an inseparable accident of
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thrice happy are they who, like Armelline, have beauty both in the face
      and body.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got home I was so fortunate as to find Margarita in a deep sleep. I
      took care not to awake her, and went to bed with as little noise as
      possible. I was in want of rest, for I no longer enjoyed the vigour of
      youth, and I slept till twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I awoke, Margarita told me that a handsome young man had called on me
      at ten o&rsquo;clock, and that she had amused him till eleven, not daring to
      awake me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made him some coffee,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and he was pleased to pronounce it
      excellent. He would not tell me his name, but he will come again tomorrow.
      He gave me a piece of money, but I hope you will not mind. I don&rsquo;t know
      how much it is worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I guessed that it was the Florentine. The piece was of two ounces. I only
      laughed, for not loving Margarita I was not jealous of her. I told her she
      had done quite right to amuse him and to accept the piece, which was worth
      forty-eight paoli.
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed me affectionately, and thanks to this incident I heard nothing
      about my having come home so late.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt curious to learn more about this generous Tuscan, so I proceeded to
      read Leonilda&rsquo;s letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      His name, it appeared, was M&mdash;&mdash;. He was a rich merchant
      established in London, and had been commended to her husband by a Knight
      of Malta.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonilda said he was generous, good-hearted, and polished, and assured me
      that I should like him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After telling me the family news, Leonilda concluded by saying that she
      was in a fair way to become a mother, and that she would be perfectly
      happy if she gave birth to a son. She begged me to congratulate the
      marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether from a natural instinct or the effects of prejudice, this news
      made me shudder. I answered her letter in a few days, enclosing it in a
      letter to the marquis, in which I told him that the grace of God was never
      too late, and that I had never been so much pleased by any news as at
      hearing he was likely to have an heir.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following May Leonilda gave birth to a son, whom I saw at Prague,
      on the occasion of the coronation of Leopold. He called himself Marquis C&mdash;&mdash;,
      like his father, or perhaps we had better say like his mother&rsquo;s husband,
      who attained the age of eighty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the young marquis did not know my name, I got introduced to him,
      and had the pleasure of meeting him a second time at the theatre. He was
      accompanied by a priest, who was called his governor, but such an office
      was a superfluity for him, who was wiser at twenty than most men are at
      sixty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was delighted to see that the young man was the living image of the old
      marquis. I shed tears of joy as I thought how this likeness must have
      pleased the old man and his wife, and I admired this chance which seemed
      to have abetted nature in her deceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote to my dear Leonilda, placing the letter in the hands of her son.
      She did not get it till the Carnival of 1792, when the young marquis
      returned to Naples; and a short time after I received an answer inviting
      me to her son&rsquo;s marriage and begging me to spend the remainder of my days
      with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows? I may eventually do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I called on the Princess Santa Croce at three o&rsquo;clock, and found her in
      bed, with the cardinal reading to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first question she asked was, why I had left the opera at the end of
      the second act.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Princess, I can tell you an interesting history of my six hours of
      adventure, but you must give me a free hand, for some of the episodes must
      be told strictly after nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it anything in the style of Sister M&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
       asked the cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lord, something of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Princess, will you be deaf?&rdquo; said his eminence,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then told my tale almost as I have written it. The slipping oysters and
      the game of blind man&rsquo;s buff made the princess burst with laughing, in
      spite of her deafness. She agreed with the cardinal that I had acted with
      great discretion, and told me that I should be sure to succeed on the next
      attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In three or four days,&rdquo; said the cardinal, &ldquo;you will have the
      dispensation, and then Emilie can marry whom she likes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the Florentine came to see me at nine o&rsquo;clock, and I
      found him to answer to the marchioness&rsquo;s description; but I had a bone to
      pick with him, and I was none the better pleased when he began asking me
      about the young person in my box at the theatre; he wanted to know whether
      she were married or engaged, if she had father, mother, or any other
      relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I smiled sardonically, and begged to be excused giving him the required
      information, as the young lady was masked when he saw her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He blushed, and begged my pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him for doing Margarita the honour of accepting a cup of coffee
      from her hands, and begged him to take one with me, saying I would
      breakfast with him next morning. He lived with Roland, opposite St.
      Charles, where Madame Gabrieli, the famous singer, nicknamed la Coghetta,
      lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the Florentine was gone, I went to St. Paul&rsquo;s in hot haste, for
      I longed to see what reception I should have from the two vestals I had
      initiated so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they appeared I noticed a great change. Emilie had become gay, while
      Armelline looked sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told the former that she should have her dispensation in three days, and
      her warrant for four hundred crowns in a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the same time,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;you shall have your grant of two hundred
      crowns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this happy tidings she ran to tell the superioress of her good fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I was alone with Armelline I took her hands and covered them
      with kisses, begging her to resume her wonted gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I do,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;without Emilie? What shall I do when you are
      gone? I am unhappy. I love myself no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shed tears which pierced me to the heart. I swore I would not leave
      Rome till I had seen her married with a dowry of a thousand crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a thousand crowns, but I hope you will see me married as you
      say; if you do not keep your promise it will kill me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would die rather than deceive you; but you on your side must forgive my
      love, which, perhaps, made me go too far the other evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgive you everything if you will remain my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will; and now let me kiss your beautiful lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this first kiss, which I took as a pledge of certain victory, she
      wiped away her tears; and soon after Emilie reappeared, accompanied by the
      superioress, who treated me with great cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to do as much for Armelline&rsquo;s new friend as you have done for
      Emilie,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do everything in my power,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;and in return I hope you
      will allow me to take these young ladies to the theatre this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find them ready; how could I refuse you anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I was alone with the two friends I apologised for having disposed of
      them without their consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our consent!&rdquo; said Emilie: &ldquo;we should be ungrateful indeed if we refused
      you anything after all you have done for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Armelline, will you withstand my love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; so long as it keeps within due bounds. No more blind man&rsquo;s buff!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is such a nice game! You really grieve me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, invent another game,&rdquo; said Emilie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emilie was becoming ardent, somewhat to my annoyance, for I was afraid
      Armelline would get jealous. I must not be charged with foppishness on
      this account. I knew the human heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I left them I went to the Tordinona Theatre and took a box, and then
      ordered a good supper at the same inn, not forgetting the oysters, though
      I felt sure I should not require their aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then called on a musician, whom I requested to get me three tickets for
      a ball, where no one would be likely to know me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went home with the idea of dining by myself, but I found a note from the
      Marchioness d&rsquo;Aout, reproaching me in a friendly manner for not having
      broken bread with her, and inviting me to dinner. I resolved to accept the
      invitation, and when I got to the house I found the young Florentine
      already there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this dinner that I found out many of his good qualities, and I
      saw that Donna Leonilda had not said too much in his favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of the meal the marchioness asked why I had not stayed
      till the end of the opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the young ladies were getting tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have found out that they do not belong to the Venetian ambassador&rsquo;s
      household.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, and I hope you will pardon my small fiction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an impromptu effort to avoid telling me who they are, but they are
      known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I congratulate the curious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one I addressed deserves to excite general curiosity; but if I were
      in your place I should make her use a little powder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the authority to do so, and if I had, I would not trouble her
      for the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was pleased with the Florentine, who listened to all this without saying
      a word. I got him to talk of England and of his business. He told me that
      he was going to Florence to take possession of his inheritance, and to get
      a wife to take back with him to London. As I left, I told him that I could
      not have the pleasure of calling on him till the day after next, as I was
      prevented by important business. He told me I must come at dinnertime, and
      I promised to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of love and hope, I went for my two friends, who enjoyed the whole
      play without any interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we alighted at the inn I told the coachman to call for me at two, and
      we then went up to the third floor, where we sat before the fire while the
      oysters were being opened. They did not interest us as they had done
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emilie had an important air; she was about to make a good marriage.
      Armelline was meek, smiling, and affectionate, and reminded me of the
      promise I had given her. I replied by ardent kisses which reassured her,
      while they warned her that I would fain increase the responsibility I had
      already contracted towards her. However, she seemed resigned, and I sat
      down to table in a happy frame of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Emilie was on the eve of her wedding, she no doubt put down my neglect
      of her to my respect for the sacrament of matrimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      When supper was over I got on the sofa with Armelline, and spent three
      hours which might have been delicious if I had not obstinately endeavoured
      to obtain the utmost favour. She would not give in; all my supplications
      and entreaties could not move her; she was sweet, but firm. She lay
      between my arms, but would not grant what I wanted, though she gave me no
      harsh or positive refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems a puzzle, but in reality it is quite simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left my arms a virgin, sorry, perhaps, that her sense of duty had not
      allowed her to make me completely happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last nature bade me cease, in spite of my love, and I begged her to
      forgive me. My instinct told me that this was the only way by which I
      might obtain her consent another time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half merry and half sad, we awoke Emilie who was in a deep sleep, and then
      we started. I went home and got into bed, not troubling myself about the
      storm of abuse with which Margarita greeted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Florentine gave me a delicious dinner, overwhelmed me with
      protestations of friendship, and offered me his purse if I needed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had seen Armelline, and had been pleased with her. I had answered him
      sharply when he questioned me about her, and ever since he had never
      mentioned her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt grateful to him, and as if I must make him some return.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him to dinner, and had Margarita to dine with us. Not caring for
      her I should have been glad if he had fallen in love with her; there would
      have been no difficulty, I believe, on her part, and certainly not on
      mine; but nothing came of it. She admired a trinket which hung from his
      watch-chain, and he begged my permission to give it her. I told him to do
      so by all means, and that should have been enough; but the affair went no
      farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a week all the arrangements for Emilie&rsquo;s marriage had been made. I gave
      her her grant, and the same day she was married and went away with her
      husband to Civita Vecchia. Menicuccio, whose name I have not mentioned for
      some time, was well pleased with my relations with his sister, foreseeing
      advantages for himself, and still better pleased with the turn his own
      affairs were taking, for three days after Emilie&rsquo;s wedding he married his
      mistress, and set up in a satisfactory manner. When Emilie was gone the
      superioress gave Armelline a new companion. She was only a few years older
      than my sweetheart, and very pretty; but she did not arouse a strong
      interest in my breast. When violently in love no other woman has ever had
      much power over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The superioress told me that her name was Scholastica, and that she was
      well worthy of my esteem, being, as she said, as good as Emilie. She
      expressed a hope that I would do my best to help Scholastica to marry a
      man whom she knew and who was in a good position.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man was the son of a cousin of Scholastica&rsquo;s. She called him her
      nephew, though he was older than she. The dispensation could easily be got
      for money, but if it was to be had for nothing I should have to make
      interest with the Holy Father. I promised I would do my best in the
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carnival was drawing to a close, and Scholastica had never seen an
      opera or a play. Armelline wanted to see a ball, and I had at last
      succeeded in finding one where it seemed unlikely that I should be
      recognized. However, it would have to be carefully managed, as serious
      consequences might ensue; so I asked the two friends if they would wear
      men&rsquo;s clothes, to which they agreed very heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had taken a box at the Aliberti Theatre for the day after the ball, so I
      told the two girls to obtain the necessary permission from the
      superioress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Armelline&rsquo;s resistance and the presence of her new friend
      discouraged me, I procured everything requisite to transform them into two
      handsome lads.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Armelline got into the carriage she gave me the bad news that
      Scholastica knew nothing about our relations, and that we must be careful
      what we did before her. I had no time to reply, for Scholastica got in,
      and we drove off to the inn. When we were seated in front of a good fire,
      I told them that if they liked I would go into the next room in spite of
      the cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, I shewed them their disguises, and Armelline said it would do
      if I turned my back, appealing to Scholastics to confirm her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do as you like,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but I am very sorry to be in the way.
      You are in love with each other, and here am I preventing you from giving
      one another marks of your affection. Why don&rsquo;t you treat me with
      confidence? I am not a child, and I am your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These remarks shewed that she had plenty of common sense, and I breathed
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, fair Scholastics,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I do love Armelline, but she
      does not love me, and refuses to make me happy on one pretence or
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words I left the room, and after shutting the door behind me
      proceeded to make up a fire in the second apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a quarter of an hour Armelline knocked at the door, and begged me to
      open it. She was in her breeches, and said they needed my assistance as
      their shoes were so small they could not get them on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in rather a sulky humour, so she threw her arms round my neck and
      covered my face with kisses which soon restored me to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was explaining the reason of my ill temper, and kissing whatever I
      could see, Scholastica burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sure that I was in the way,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;and if you do not trust me,
      I warn you that I will not go with you to the opera to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, embrace him,&rdquo; said Armelline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not much care for Armelline&rsquo;s generosity, but I embraced Scholastica
      as warmly as she deserved. Indeed I would have done so if she had been
      less pretty, for such kindly consideration deserved a reward. I even
      kissed her more ardently than I need have done, with the idea of punishing
      Armelline, but I made a mistake. She was delighted, and kissed her friend
      affectionately as if in gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made them sit down, and tried to pull on their shoes, but I soon found
      that they were much too small, and that we must get some more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I called the waiter who attended to us, and told him to go and fetch a
      bootmaker with an assortment of shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile I would not be contented with merely kissing Armelline.
      She neither dared to grant nor to refuse; and as if to relieve herself of
      any responsibility, made Scholastica submit to all the caresses I lavished
      on her. The latter seconded my efforts with an ardour that would have
      pleased me exceedingly if I had been in love with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was exceedingly beautiful, and her features were as perfectly
      chiselled as Armelline&rsquo;s, but Armelline was possessed of a delicate and
      subtle charm of feature peculiar to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I liked the amusement well enough, but there was a drop of bitterness in
      all my enjoyment. I thought it was plain that Armelline did not love me,
      and that Scholastica only encouraged me to encourage her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I came to the conclusion that I should do well to attach myself to
      the one who seemed likely to give me the completest satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I conceived this idea I felt curious to see whether Armelline
      would discover any jealousy if I shewed myself really in love with
      Scholastica, and if the latter pronounced me to be too daring, for
      hitherto my hands had not crossed the Rubicon of their waistbands. I was
      just going to work when the shoemaker arrived, and in a few minutes the
      girls were well fitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      They put on their coats, and I saw two handsome young men before me, while
      their figures hinted their sex sufficiently to make a third person jealous
      of my good fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave orders for supper to be ready at midnight, and we went to the ball.
      I would have wagered a hundred to one that no one would recognize me
      there, as the man who got the tickets had assured me that it was a
      gathering of small tradesmen. But who can trust to fate or chance?
    </p>
    <p>
      We went into the hall, and the first person I saw was the Marchioness
      d&rsquo;Aout, with her husband and her inseparable abbe.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt I turned a thousand colours, but it was no good going back, for
      the marchioness had recognized me, so I composed myself and went up to
      her. We exchanged the usual compliments of polite society, to which she
      added some good-natured though ironical remarks on my two young friends.
      Not being accustomed to company, they remained confused and speechless.
      But the worst of all was to come. A tall young lady who had just finished
      a minuet came up to Armelline, dropped a curtsy, and asked her to dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this young lady I recognized the Florentine who had disguised himself
      as a girl, and looked a very beautiful one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armelline thought she would not appear a dupe, and said she recognized
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are making a mistake,&rdquo; said he, calmly. &ldquo;I have a brother who is very
      like me, just as you have a sister who is your living portrait. My brother
      had the pleasure of exchanging a few words with her at the Capronica.&rdquo; The
      Florentine&rsquo;s cleverness made the marchioness laugh, and I had to join in
      her mirth, though I felt little inclination to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armelline begged to be excused dancing, so the marchioness made her sit
      between the handsome Florentine and herself. The marquis took possession
      of Scholastica, and I had to be attentive to the marchioness without
      seeming to be aware of the existence of Armelline, to whom the Florentine
      was talking earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt as jealous as a tiger; and having to conceal my rage under an air
      of perfect satisfaction, the reader may imagine how well I enjoyed the
      ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there was more anxiety in store for me; for presently I noticed
      Scholastica leave the marquis, and go apart with a middle-aged man, with
      whom she conversed in an intimate manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minuets over, the square dances began, and I thought I was dreaming
      when I saw Armelline and the Florentine taking their places.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came up to congratulate them, and asked Armelline, gently, if she was
      sure of the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This gentleman says I have only to imitate him, and that I cannot
      possibly make any mistakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had nothing to say to this, so I went towards Scholastica, feeling very
      curious to know who was her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she saw me she introduced me to him, saying timidly that this
      was the nephew of whom she had spoken, the same that wished to marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was surprised, but I did not let it appear. I told him that the
      superioress had spoken of him to me, and that I was thinking over the ways
      and means of obtaining a dispensation without any costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an honest-looking man, and thanked me heartily, commending himself
      to my good offices, as he said he was far from rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left them together, and on turning to view the dance I was astonished to
      see that Armelline was dancing admirably, and executing all the figures.
      The Florentine seemed a finished dancer, and they both looked very happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was far from pleased, but I congratulated them both on their
      performance. The Florentine had disguised himself so admirably that no one
      would have taken him for a man. It was the Marchioness d&rsquo;Aout who had been
      his dresser.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was too jealous to leave Armelline to her own devices, I refused to
      dance, preferring to watch her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not at all uneasy about Scholastica, who was with her betrothed.
      About half-past eleven the Marchioness d&rsquo;Aout, who was delighted with
      Armelline, and possibly had her protege&rsquo;s happiness in view, asked me, in
      a tone that amounted to a command, to sup with her in company with my two
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot have the honour,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and my two companions know the
      reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is as much as to say,&rdquo; said the marchioness, &ldquo;that he will do as you
      please,&rdquo; turning to Armelline as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      I addressed myself to Armelline, and observed smilingly that she knew
      perfectly well that she must be home by half-past twelve at latest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but you can do as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I replied somewhat sadly that I did not feel myself at liberty to break my
      word, but that she could make me do even that if she chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the marchioness, her husband, the abbe, and the Florentine,
      urged her to use her power to make me break my supposed word, and
      Armelline actually began to presume to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was bursting with rage; but making up my mind to do anything rather than
      appear jealous, I said simply that I would gladly consent if her friend
      would consent also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said she, with a pleased air that cut me to the quick, &ldquo;go
      and ask her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was enough for me. I went to Scholastica and told her the
      circumstances in the presence of her lover, begging her to refuse without
      compromising me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lover said I was perfectly right, but Scholastica required no
      persuasion, telling me that she had quite made up her mind not to sup with
      anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came with me, and I told her to speak to Armelline apart before saying
      anything to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      I led Scholastica before the marchioness, bewailing my want of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scholastica told Armelline that she wanted to say a few words to her
      aside, and after a short conversation they came back looking sorry, and
      Armelline told the marchioness that she found it would be impossible for
      them to come. The lady did not press us any longer, so we went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told Scholastica&rsquo;s intended to keep what had passed to himself, and
      asked him to dine with me on the day after Ash Wednesday.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was dark, and we walked to the place where I had ordered the
      carriage to be in waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      To me it was as if I had come out of hell, and on the way to the inn I did
      not speak a word, not even answering the questions which the too-simple
      Armelline addressed to me in a voice that would have softened a heart of
      stone. Scholastica avenged me by reproaching her for having obliged me to
      appear either rude or jealous, or a breaker of my word.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got to the inn Armelline changed my jealous rage into pity; her
      eyes swam with tears, which Scholastica&rsquo;s home truths had drawn forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper was ready, so they had no time to change their dress. I was sad
      enough, but I could not bear to see Armelline sad also. I resolved to do
      my best to drive away her melancholy, even though I suspected that it
      arose from love of the Florentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper was excellent, and Scholastica did honour to it, while
      Armelline, contrary to her wont, scarcely touched a thing. Scholastica was
      charming. She embraced her friend, and told her to be merry with her, as I
      had become the friend of her betrothed, and she was sure I would do as
      much for her as I had done for Emilie. She blessed the ball and the chance
      which had brought him there. In short, she did her best to shew Armelline
      that with my love she had no reason to be sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armelline dared not disclose the true cause of her sadness. The fact was,
      that she wanted to get married, and the handsome Florentine was the man to
      her liking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our supper came to an end, and still Armelline was gloomy. She only drank
      one glass of punch, and as she had eaten so little I would not try and
      make her drink more for fear lest it should do her harm. Scholastica, on
      the other hand, took such a fancy to this agreeable fluid, which she
      tasted for the first time, that she drank deeply, and was amazed to find
      it mounting to her head instead of descending to her stomach. In this
      pleasant state, she felt it was her duty to reconcile Armelline and
      myself, and to assure us that we might be as tender as we liked without
      minding her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting up from table and standing with some difficulty, she carried her
      friend to the sofa, and caressed her in such a way that Armelline could
      not help laughing, despite her sadness. Then she called me and placed her
      in my arms. I caressed her, and Armelline, though she did not repulse me,
      did not respond as Scholastica had hoped. I was not disappointed; I did
      not think it likely she would grant now what she had refused to grant when
      I had held her in my arms for those hours whilst Emilie was fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Scholastica began to reproach me with my coldness, though I
      deserved no blame at all on this score.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told them to take off their men&rsquo;s clothes, and to dress themselves as
      women.
    </p>
    <p>
      I helped Scholastica to take off her coat and waistcoat, and then aided
      Armelline in a similar manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I brought them their chemises, Armelline told me to go and stand by
      the fire, and I did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long a noise of kissing made me turn round, and I saw Scholastica,
      on whom the punch had taken effect, devouring Armelline&rsquo;s breast with
      kisses. At last this treatment had the desired result; Armelline became
      gay, and gave as good as she got.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this sight the blood boiled in my veins, and running to them I found
      Scholastic was not ill pleased that I should do justice to her beautiful
      spheres, while for the nonce I transformed her into a nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armelline was ashamed to appear less generous than her friend, and
      Scholastica was triumphant when she saw the peculiar use to which (for the
      first time) I put Armelline&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armelline called to her friend to help, and she was not backward; but in
      spite of her twenty years her astonishment at the catastrophe was great.
    </p>
    <p>
      After it was over I put on their chemises and took off their breeches with
      all the decency imaginable, and after spending a few minutes in the next
      room they came and sat down on my knee of their own accord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scholastica, instead of being annoyed at my giving the preference to the
      hidden charms of Armelline, seemed delighted, watching what I did, and how
      Armelline took it, with the closest attention. She no doubt longed to see
      me perform the magnum opus, but the gentle Armelline would not allow me to
      go so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I had finished with Armelline I recollected I had duties towards
      Scholastica, and I proceeded to inspect her charms.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult to decide which of the two deserved to carry off the
      apple. Scholastica, perhaps, was strictly speaking the more beautiful of
      the two, but I loved Armelline, and love casts a glamour over the beloved
      object. Scholastica appeared to me to be as pure a virgin as Armelline,
      and I saw that I might do what I liked with her. But I would not abuse my
      liberty, not caring to confess how powerful an ally the punch had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I did all in my power to give her pleasure without giving her the
      greatest pleasure of all. Scholastica, was glutted with voluptuous
      enjoyment, and was certain that I had only eluded her desires from motives
      of delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took them back to the convent, assuring them that I would take them to
      the opera on the following evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to bed, doubtful whether I had gained a victory or sustained a
      defeat; and it was not till I awoke that I was in a position to give a
      decided opinion.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Madame Denis&mdash;Dedini&mdash;Zanovitch&mdash;Zen&mdash;I Am Obliged to Leave&mdash;
     I Arrive at Bologna&mdash;General Albergati
</pre>
    <p>
      Without speaking at any length I asked the young grand duke to give me an
      asylum in his dominions for as long as I might care to stay. I anticipated
      any questions he might have asked by telling him the reasons which had
      made me an exile from my native land.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to my necessities,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;I shall ask for help of no one; I have
      sufficient funds to ensure my independence. I think of devoting the whole
      of my time to study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long as your conduct is good,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;the laws guarantee your
      freedom; but I am glad you have applied to me. Whom do you know in
      Florence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten years ago, my lord, I had some distinguished acquaintances here; but
      now I propose to live in retirement, and do not intend renewing any old
      friendships.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was my conversation with the young sovereign, and after his
      assurances I concluded that no one would molest me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My adventures in Tuscany the years before were in all probability
      forgotten, or almost forgotten, as the new Government had nothing in
      common with the old.
    </p>
    <p>
      After my interview with the grand duke I went to a bookseller&rsquo;s shop and
      ordered some books. A gentleman in the shop, hearing me making enquiries
      about Greek works, accosted me, and we got on well together. I told him I
      was working at a translation of the &ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; and in return he informed me
      that he was making a collection of Greek epigrams, which he wished to
      publish in Greek and Italian. I told him I should like to see this work,
      whereupon he asked me where I lived. I told him, learnt his name and
      address, and called on him the next day. He returned the visit, and we
      became fast friends, though we never either walked or ate together.
    </p>
    <p>
      This worthy Florentine was named (or is named, if he be still alive)
      Everard de Medici.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was very comfortable with Allegranti; I had the quiet so necessary to
      literary labours, but nevertheless I made up my mind to change my lodging.
      Magdalena, my landlord&rsquo;s niece, was so clever and charming, though but a
      child, that she continually disturbed my studies. She came into my room,
      wished me good day, asked me what kind of a night I had spent, if I wanted
      anything, and the sight of her grace and beauty and the sound of her voice
      so ravished me, that I determined to seek safety in flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few years later Magdalena became a famous musician.
    </p>
    <p>
      After leaving Allegranti I took rooms in a tradesman&rsquo;s house; his wife was
      ugly, and he had no pretty daughters or seductive nieces. There I lived
      for three weeks like Lafontaine&rsquo;s rat, very discreetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the same time, Count Stratico arrived at Florence with his pupil,
      the Chevalier Morosini, who was then eighteen. I could not avoid calling
      on Stratico. He had broken his leg some time before and was still unable
      to go out with his pupil, who had all the vices and none of the virtues of
      youth. Consequently, Stratico was always afraid of something happening to
      him, and he begged me to make myself his companion, and even to share his
      pleasures, so that he might not go into bad company and dangerous houses
      alone and undefended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus my days of calm study vanished away. I had to partake in the
      debauchery of a young rake, and all out of pure sensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chevalier Morosini was a thorough-paced profligate. He hated
      literature, good society, and the company of sensible people. His daily
      pleasures were furious riding, hard drinking, and hard dissipation with
      prostitutes, whom he sometimes almost killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This young nobleman paid a man for the sole service of getting him a woman
      or a girl every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the two months which he passed in Florence I saved his life a score
      of times. I got very tired of my duty, but I felt bound to persevere.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was liberal to the verge of recklessness, and would never allow me to
      pay for anything. Even here, however, disputes often arose between us; as
      he paid, he wanted me to eat, drink, and dissipate in the same measures as
      himself. However, I had my own way on most occasions, only giving in when
      it suited me to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went to see the opera at Lucca, and brought two of the dancers home to
      supper. As the chevalier was drunk as usual, he treated the woman he had
      chosen&mdash;a superb creature&mdash;very indifferently. The other was
      pretty enough, but I had done nothing serious with her, so I proceeded to
      avenge the beauty. She took me for the chevalier&rsquo;s father, and advised me
      to give him a better education.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the chevalier was gone I betook myself to my studies again, but I
      supped every night with Madame Denis, who had formerly been a dancer in
      the King of Prussia&rsquo;s service, and had retired to Florence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was about my age, and therefore not young, but still she had
      sufficient remains of her beauty to inspire a tender passion; she did not
      look more than thirty. She was as fresh as a young girl, had excellent
      manners, and was extremely intelligent. Besides all these advantages, she
      had a comfortable apartment on the first floor of one of the largest cafes
      in Florence. In front of her room was a balcony where it was delicious to
      sit and enjoy the cool of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader may remember how I had become her friend at Berlin in 1764, and
      when we met again at Florence our old flames were rekindled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief boarder in the house where she lived was Madame Brigonzi, whom I
      had met at Memel. This lady, who pretended that she had been my mistress
      twenty-five years before, often came into Madame Denis&rsquo;s rooms with an old
      lover of hers named Marquis Capponi.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an agreeable and well-educated man; and noticing that he seemed to
      enjoy my conversation I called on him, and he called on me, leaving his
      card as I was not at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned the visit, and he introduced me to his family and invited me to
      dinner. For the first time since I had come to Florence I dressed myself
      with elegance and wore my jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Marquis Capponi&rsquo;s I made the acquaintance of Corilla&rsquo;s lover, the
      Marquis Gennori, who took me to a house where I met my fate. I fell in
      love with Madame, a young widow, who had been spending a few months in
      Paris. This visit had added to her other attractions the charm of a good
      manner, which always counts for so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      This unhappy love made the three months longer which I spent in Florence
      painful to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the beginning of October, and about that time Count Medini
      arrived at Florence without a penny in his pocket, and without being able
      to pay his vetturino, who had arrested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wretched man, who seemed to follow me wherever I went, had taken up
      his abode in the house of a poor Irishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know how Medini found out that I was at Florence, but he wrote me
      a letter begging me to come and deliver him from the police, who besieged
      his room and talked of taking him to prison. He said he only wanted me to
      go bail for him, and protested that I should not run any risk, as he was
      sure of being able to pay in a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      My readers will be aware that I had good reason for not liking Medini, but
      in spite of our quarrel I could not despise his entreaty. I even felt
      inclined to become his surety, if he could prove his capability of paying
      the sum for which he had been arrested. I imagined that the sum must be a
      small one, and could not understand why the landlord did not answer for
      him. My surprise ceased, however, when I entered his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I appeared he ran to embrace me, begging me to forget the past,
      and to extract him from the painful position in which he found himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cast a rapid glance over the room, and saw three trunks almost empty,
      their contents being scattered about the floor. There was his mistress,
      whom I knew, and who had her reasons for not liking me; her young sister,
      who wept; and her mother, who swore, and called Medini a rogue, saying
      that she would complain of him to the magistrate, and that she was not
      going to allow her dresses and her daughter&rsquo;s dresses to be seized for his
      debts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked the landlord why he did not go bail, as he had these persons and
      their effects as security.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole lot,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t pay the vetturino, and the sooner
      they are out of my house the better I shall be pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was astonished, and could not understand how the bill could amount to
      more than the value of all the clothes I saw on the floor, so I asked the
      vetturino to tell me the extent of the debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave me a paper with Medini&rsquo;s signature; the amount was two hundred and
      forty crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in the world,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;could he contract this enormous debt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wondered no longer when the vetturino told me that he had served them
      for the last six weeks, having conducted the count and the three women
      from Rome to Leghorn, and from Leghorn to Pisa, and from Pisa to Florence,
      paying for their board all the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The vetturino will never take me as bail for such an amount,&rdquo; I said to
      Medini, &ldquo;and even if he would I should never be so foolish as to contract
      such a debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me have a word with you in the next room,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I will put the
      matter clearly before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two of the police would have prevented his going into the next room, on
      the plea that he might escape through the window, but I said I would be
      answerable for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the poor vetturino came in and kissed my hand, saying that if I
      would go bail for the count he would let me have three months wherein to
      find the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it happened it was the same man who had taken me to Rome with the
      Englishwoman who had been seduced by the actor l&rsquo;Etoile. I told him to
      wait a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medini who was a great talker and a dreadful liar thought to persuade me
      by shewing me a number of open letters, commending him in pompous terms to
      the best houses in Florence. I read the letters, but I found no mention of
      money in them, and I told him as much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but there is play going on in these houses, and I am
      sure of gaining immense sums.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be aware that I have no confidence in your good luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I have another resource.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shewed me a bundle of manuscript, which I found to be an excellent
      translation of Voltaire&rsquo;s &ldquo;Henriade&rdquo; into Italian verse. Tasso himself
      could not have done it better. He said he hoped to finish the poem at
      Florence, and to present it to the grand duke, who would be sure to make
      him a magnificent present, and to constitute him his favourite.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would not undeceive him, but I laughed to myself, knowing that the grand
      duke only made a pretence of loving literature. A certain Abbe Fontaine, a
      clever man, amused him with a little natural history, the only science in
      which he took any interest. He preferred the worst prose to the best
      verse, not having sufficient intellect to enjoy the subtle charms of
      poetry. In reality he had only two passions&mdash;women and money.
    </p>
    <p>
      After spending two wearisome hours with Medini, whose wit was great and
      his judgment small, after heartily repenting of having yielded to my
      curiosity and having paid him a visit, I said shortly that I could do
      nothing for him. Despair drives men crazy; as I was making for the door,
      he seized me by the collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not reflect in his dire extremity that he had no arms, that I was
      stronger than he, that I had twice drawn his blood, and that the police,
      the landlord, the vetturino, and the servants, were in the next room. I
      was not coward enough to call for help; I caught hold of his neck with
      both hands and squeezed him till he was nearly choked. He had to let go at
      last, and then I took hold of his collar and asked him if he had gone mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sent him against the wall, and opened the door and the police came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told the vetturino that I would on no account be Medini&rsquo;s surety, or be
      answerable for him in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as I was going out, he leapt forward crying that I must not abandon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had opened the door, and the police, fearing he would escape, ran
      forward to get hold of him. Then began an interesting battle. Medini, who
      had no arms, and was only in his dressing-gown, proceeded to distribute
      kicks, cuffs, and blows amongst the four cowards, who had their swords at
      their sides, whilst I held the door to prevent the Irishman going out and
      calling for assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medini, whose nose was bleeding and his dress all torn, persisted in
      fighting till the four policemen let him alone. I liked his courage, and
      pitied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, and I asked his two liveried servants who
      were standing by me why they had not helped their master. One said he owed
      him six months&rsquo; wages, and the other said he wanted to arrest him on his
      own account.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Medini was endeavouring to staunch the blood in a basin of water, the
      vetturino told him that as I refused to be his surety he must go to
      prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was moved by the scene that I had witnessed, and said to the vetturino,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him a fortnight&rsquo;s respite, and if he escapes before the expiration
      of that term I will pay you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought it over for a few moments, and then said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir, but I am not going to pay any legal expenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I enquired how much the costs amounted to, and paid them, laughing at the
      policemen&rsquo;s claim of damages for blows they had received.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the two rascally servants said that if I would not be surety in the
      same manner on their account, they would have Medini arrested. However,
      Medini called out to me to pay no attention to them whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had given the vetturino his acknowledgment and paid the four or
      five crowns charged by the police, Medini told me that he had more to say
      to me; but I turned my back on him, and went home to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later one of his servants came to me and promised if I would
      give him six sequins to warn me if his master made any preparations for
      flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him drily that his zeal was useless to me, as I was quite sure that
      the count would pay all his debts within the term; and the next morning I
      wrote to Medini informing him of the step his servant had taken. He
      replied with a long letter full of thanks, in which he exerted all his
      eloquence to persuade me to repair his fortunes. I did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, his good genius, who still protected him, brought a person to
      Florence who drew him out of the difficulty. This person was Premislas
      Zanovitch, who afterwards became as famous as his brother who cheated the
      Amsterdam merchants, and adopted the style of Prince Scanderbeck. I shall
      speak of him later on. Both these finished cheats came to a bad end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Premislas Zanovitch was then at the happy age of twenty-five; he was the
      son of a gentleman of Budua, a town on the borders of Albania and
      Dalmatia, formerly subject to the Venetian Republic and now to the Grand
      Turk. In classic times it was known as Epirus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Premislas was a young man of great intelligence, and after having studied
      at Venice, and contracted a Venetian taste for pleasures and enjoyments of
      all sorts, he could not make up his mind to return to Budua, where his
      only associates would be dull Sclavs&mdash;uneducated, unintellectual,
      coarse, and brutish. Consequently, when Premislas and his still more
      talented brother Stephen were ordered by the Council of Ten to enjoy the
      vast sums they had gained at play in their own country, they resolved to
      become adventurers. One took the north and the other the south of Europe,
      and both cheated and duped whenever the opportunity for doing so presented
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had seen Premislas when he was a child, and had already heard reports of
      a notable achievement of his. At Naples he had cheated the Chevalier de
      Morosini by persuading him to become his surety to the extent of six
      thousand ducats, and now he arrived in Florence in a handsome carriage,
      bringing his mistress with him, and having two tall lackeys and a valet in
      his service.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took good apartments, hired a carriage, rented a box at the opera, had
      a skilled cook, and gave his mistress a lady-in-waiting. He then shewed
      himself at the best club, richly dressed, and covered with jewellery. He
      introduced himself under the name of Count Premislas Zanovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a club in Florence devoted to the use of the nobility. Any
      stranger can go there without being introduced, but so much the worse for
      him if his appearance fails to indicate his right to be present. The
      Florentines are ice towards him, leave him alone, and behave in such a
      manner that the visit is seldom repeated. The club is at once decent and
      licentious, the papers are to be read there, games of all kinds are
      played, food and drink may be had, and even love is available, for ladies
      frequent the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanovitch did not wait to be spoken to, but made himself agreeable to
      everyone, and congratulated himself on mixing in such distinguished
      company, talked about Naples which he had just left, brought in his own
      name with great adroitness, played high, lost merrily, paid after
      pretending to forget all about his debts, and in short pleased everyone. I
      heard all this the next day from the Marquis Capponi, who said that
      someone had asked him if he knew me, whereat he answered that when I left
      Venice he was at college, but that he had often heard his father speak of
      me in very high terms. He knew both the Chevalier Morosini and Count
      Medini, and had a good deal to say in praise of the latter. The marquis
      asked me if I knew him, and I replied in the affirmative, without feeling
      it my duty to disclose certain circumstances which might not have been
      advantageous to him; and as Madame Denis seemed curious to make his
      acquaintance the Chevalier Puzzi promised to bring him to see her, which
      he did in the course of a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      I happened to be with Madame Denis when Puzzi presented Zanovitch, and I
      saw before me a fine-looking young man, who seemed by his confident manner
      to be sure of success in all his undertakings. He was not exactly
      handsome, but he had a perfect manner and an air of gaiety which seemed
      infectious, with a thorough knowledge of the laws of good society. He was
      by no means an egotist, and seemed never at a loss for something to talk
      about. I led the conversation to the subject of his country, and he gave
      me an amusing description of it, talking of his fief&mdash;part of which was
      within the domains of the sultan&mdash;as a place where gaiety was unknown, and
      where the most determined misanthrope would die of melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he heard my name he began speaking to me in a tone of the most
      delicate flattery. I saw the makings of a great adventurer in him, but I
      thought his luxury would prove the weak point in his cuirass. I thought
      him something like what I had been fifteen years ago, but as it seemed
      unlikely that he had my resources I could not help pitying him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanovitch paid me a visit, and told me that Medini&rsquo;s position had excited
      his pity, and that he had therefore paid his debts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I applauded his generosity, but I formed the conclusion that they had laid
      some plot between them, and that I should soon hear of the results of this
      new alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned Zanovitch&rsquo;s call the next day. He was at table with his
      mistress, whom I should not have recognized if she had not pronounced my
      name directly she saw me.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she had addressed me as Don Giacomo, I called her Donna Ippolita, but
      in a voice which indicated that I was not certain of her identity. She
      told me I was quite right.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had supped with her at Naples in company with Lord Baltimore, and she
      was very pretty then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanovitch asked me to dine with him the following day, and I should have
      thanked him and begged to be excused if Donna Ippolita had not pressed me
      to come. She assured me that I should find good company there, and that
      the cook would excel himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt rather curious to see the company, and with the idea of shewing
      Zanovitch that I was not likely to become a charge on his purse, I dressed
      myself magnificently once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I had expected, I found Medini and his mistress there, with two foreign
      ladies and their attendant cavaliers, and a fine-looking and well-dressed
      Venetian, between thirty-five and forty, whom I would not have recognized
      if Zanovitch had not told me his name, Alois Zen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zen was a patrician name, and I felt obliged to ask what titles I ought
      to give him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such titles as one old friend gives another, though it is very possible
      you do not recollect me, as I was only ten years old when we saw each
      other last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zen then told me he was the son of the captain I had known when I was
      under arrest at St. Andrews.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s twenty-eight years ago; but I remember you, though you had not had
      the small-pox in those days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw that he was annoyed by this remark, but it was his fault, as he had
      no business to say where he had known me, or who his father was.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the son of a noble Venetian&mdash;a good-for-nothing in every sense
      of the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I met him at Florence he had just come from Madrid, where he had made
      a lot of money by holding a bank at faro in the house of the Venetian
      ambassador, Marco Zen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was glad to meet him, but I found out before the dinner was over that he
      was completely devoid of education and the manners of a gentleman; but he
      was well content with the one talent he possessed, namely, that of
      correcting the freaks of fortune at games of chance. I did not wait to see
      the onslaught of the cheats on the dupes, but took my leave while the
      table was being made ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was my life during the seven months which I spent at Florence.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this dinner I never saw Zen, or Medini, or Zanovitch, except by
      chance in the public places.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I must recount some incidents which took place towards the middle of
      December.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lincoln, a young man of eighteen, fell in love with a Venetian dancer
      named Lamberti, who was a universal favourite. On every night when the
      opera was given the young Englishman might be seen going to her camerino,
      and everyone wondered why he did not visit her at her own house, where he
      would be certain of a good welcome, for he was English, and therefore
      rich, young, and handsome. I believe he was the only son of the Duke of
      Newcastle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanovitch marked him down, and in a short time had become an intimate
      friend of the fair Lamberti. He then made up to Lord Lincoln, and took him
      to the lady&rsquo;s house, as a polite man takes a friend to see his mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Lamberti, who was in collusion with the rascal, was not niggardly
      of her favours with the young Englishman. She received him every night to
      supper with Zanovitch and Zen, who had been presented by the Sclav, either
      because of his capital, or because Zanovitch was not so accomplished a
      cheat.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first few nights they took care to let the young nobleman win. As
      they played after supper, and Lord Lincoln followed the noble English
      custom of drinking till he did not know his right hand from his left, he
      was quite astonished on waking the next morning to find that luck had been
      as kind to him as love. The trap was baited, the young lord nibbled, and,
      as may be expected, was finally caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zen won twelve thousand pounds of him, and Zanovitch lent him the money by
      installments of three and four hundred louis at a time, as the Englishman
      had promised his tutor not to play, on his word of honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanovitch won from Zen what Zen won from the lord, and so the game was
      kept up till the young pigeon had lost the enormous sum of twelve thousand
      guineas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lincoln promised to pay three thousand guineas the next day, and
      signed three bills of exchange for three thousand guineas each, payable in
      six months, and drawn on his London banker.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard all about this from Lord Lincoln himself when we met at Bologna
      three months later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the little gaming party was the talk of Florence. Sasso
      Sassi, the banker, had already paid Zanovitch six thousand sequins by my
      lord&rsquo;s orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medini came to see me, furious at not having been asked to join the party,
      while I congratulated myself on my absence. My surprise may be imagined,
      when, a few days after, a person came up to my room, and ordered me to
      leave Florence in three days and Tuscany in a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was petrified, and called to my landlord to witness the unrighteous
      order I had received.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was December 28th. On the same date, three years before, I had received
      orders to leave Barcelona in three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dressed hastily and went to the magistrate to enquire the reason for my
      exile, and on entering the room I found it was the same man who had
      ordered me to leave Florence eleven years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him to give me his reasons, and he replied coldly that such was
      the will of his highness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as his highness must have his reasons, it seems to me that I am
      within my rights in enquiring what they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you think so you had better betake yourself to the prince; I know
      nothing about it. He left yesterday for Pisa, where he will stay three
      days; you can go there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he pay for my journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should doubt it, but you can see for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not go to Pisa, but I will write to his highness if you will
      promise to send on the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do so immediately, for it is my duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; you shall have the letter before noon tomorrow, and before
      day-break I shall be in the States of the Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for you to hurry yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a very great hurry. I cannot breathe the air of a country where
      liberty is unknown and the sovereign breaks his word; that is what I am
      going to write to your master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I was going out I met Medini, who had come on the same business as
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed, and informed him of the results of my interview, and how I had
      been told to go to Pisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! have you been expelled, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I. Let us go to Pisa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go if you like, but I shall leave Florence tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I got home I told my landlord to get me a carriage and to order four
      post-horses for nightfall, and I then wrote the following letter to the
      grand duke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord; The thunder which Jove has placed in your hands is only for the
      guilty; in launching it at me you have done wrong. Seven months ago you
      promised that I should remain unmolested so long as I obeyed the laws. I
      have done so scrupulously, and your lordship has therefore broken your
      word. I am merely writing to you to let you know that I forgive you, and
      that I shall never give utterance to a word of complaint. Indeed I would
      willingly forget the injury you have done me, if it were not necessary
      that I should remember never to set foot in your realms again. The
      magistrate tells me that I can go and see you at Pisa, but I fear such a
      step would seem a hardy one to a prince, who should hear what a man has to
      say before he condemns him, and not afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, etc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I had finished the letter I sent it to the magistrate, and then I
      began my packing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sitting down to dinner when Medini came in cursing Zen and
      Zanovitch, whom he accused of being the authors of his misfortune, and of
      refusing to give him a hundred sequins, without which he could not
      possibly go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all going to Pisa,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and cannot imagine why you do not
      come, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; I said, laughingly, &ldquo;but please to leave me now as I have to
      do my packing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I expected, he wanted me to lend him some money, but on my giving him a
      direct refusal he went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner I took leave of M. Medici and Madame Dennis, the latter of
      whom had heard the story already. She cursed the grand duke, saying she
      could not imagine how he could confound the innocent with the guilty. She
      informed me that Madame Lamberti had received orders to quit, as also a
      hunchbacked Venetian priest, who used to go and see the dancer but had
      never supped with her. In fact, there was a clean sweep of all the
      Venetians in Florence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was returning home I met Lord Lincoln&rsquo;s governor; whom I had known at
      Lausanne eleven years before. I told him of what had happened to me
      through his hopeful pupil getting himself fleeced. He laughed, and told me
      that the grand duke had advised Lord Lincoln not to pay the money he had
      lost, to which the young man replied that if he were not to pay he should
      be dishonoured since the money he had lost had been lent to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In leaving Florence I was cured of an unhappy love which would doubtless
      have had fatal consequences if I had stayed on. I have spared my readers
      the painful story because I cannot recall it to my mind even now without
      being cut to the heart. The widow whom I loved, and to whom I was so weak
      as to disclose my feelings, only attached me to her triumphal car to
      humiliate me, for she disdained my love and myself. I persisted in my
      courtship, and nothing but my enforced absence would have cured me.
    </p>
    <p>
      As yet I have not learnt the truth of the maxim that old age, especially
      when devoid of fortune, is not likely to prove attractive to youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left Florence poorer by a hundred sequins than when I came there. I had
      lived with the most careful economy throughout the whole of my stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped at the first stage within the Pope&rsquo;s dominions, and by the last
      day but one of the year I was settled at Bologna, at &ldquo;St. Mark&rsquo;s Hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My first visit was paid to Count Marulli, the Florentine charge
      d&rsquo;affaires. I begged him to write and tell his master, that, out of
      gratitude for my banishment, I should never cease to sing his praises.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the count had received a letter containing an account of the whole
      affair, he could not quite believe that I meant what I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may think what you like,&rdquo; I observed, &ldquo;but if you knew all you would
      see that his highness has done me a very great service though quite
      unintentionally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He promised to let his master know how I spoke of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On January 1st, 1772, I presented myself to Cardinal Braneaforte, the
      Pope&rsquo;s legate, whom I had known twenty years before at Paris, when he had
      been sent by Benedict XVI. with the holy swaddling clothes for the
      newly-born Duke of Burgundy. We had met at the Lodge of Freemasons, for
      the members of the sacred college were by no means afraid of their own
      anathemas. We had also some very pleasant little suppers with pretty
      sinners in company with Don Francesco Sensate and Count Ranucci. In short,
      the cardinal was a man of wit, and what is called a bon vivant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, here you are!&rdquo; cried he, when he saw me; &ldquo;I was expecting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you, my lord? Why should I have come to Bologna rather than to
      any other place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For two reasons. In the first place because Bologna is better than many
      other places, and besides I flatter myself you thought of me. But you
      needn&rsquo;t say anything here about the life we led together when we were
      young men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has always been a pleasant recollection to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt. Count Marulli told me yesterday that you spoke very highly of
      the grand duke, and you are quite right. You can talk to me in confidence;
      the walls of this room have no ears. How much did you get of the twelve
      thousand guineas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him the whole story, and shewed him a copy of the letter which I
      had written to the grand duke. He laughed, and said he was sorry I had
      been punished for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he heard I thought of staying some months at Bologna he told me that
      I might reckon on perfect freedom, and that as soon as the matter ceased
      to become common talk he would give me open proof of his friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      After seeing the cardinal I resolved to continue at Bologna the kind of
      life that I had been leading at Florence. Bologna is the freest town in
      all Italy; commodities are cheap and good, and all the pleasures of life
      may be had there at a low price. The town is a fine one, and the streets
      are lined with arcades&mdash;a great comfort in so hot a place.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to society, I did not trouble myself about it. I knew the Bolognese;
      the nobles are proud, rude, and violent; the lowest orders, known as the
      birichini, are worse than the lazzaroni of Naples, while the tradesmen and
      the middle classes are generally speaking worthy and respectable people.
      At Bologna, as at Naples, the two extremes of society are corrupt, while
      the middle classes are respectable, and the depository of virtue, talents,
      and learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, my intention was to leave society alone, to pass my time in
      study, and to make the acquaintance of a few men of letters, who are
      easily accessible everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Florence ignorance is the rule and learning the exception, while at
      Bologna the tincture of letters is almost universal. The university has
      thrice the usual number of professors; but they are all ill paid, and have
      to get their living out of the students, who are numerous. Printing is
      cheaper at Bologna than anywhere else, and though the Inquisition is
      established there the press is almost entirely free.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the exiles from Florence reached Bologna four or five days after
      myself. Madame Lamberti only passed through on her way to Venice.
      Zanovitch and Zen stayed five or six days; but they were no longer in
      partnership, having quarreled over the sharing of the booty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanovitch had refused to make one of Lord Lincoln&rsquo;s bills of exchange
      payable to Zen, because he did not wish to make himself liable in case the
      Englishman refused to pay. He wanted to go to England, and told Zen he was
      at liberty to do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to Milan without having patched up their quarrel, but the
      Milanese Government ordered them to leave Lombardy, and I never heard what
      arrangements they finally came to. Later on I was informed that the
      Englishman&rsquo;s bills had all been settled to the uttermost farthing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medini, penniless as usual, had taken up his abode in the hotel where I
      was staying, bringing with him his mistress, her sister, and her mother,
      but with only one servant. He informed me that the grand duke had refused
      to listen to any of them at Pisa, where he had received a second order to
      leave Tuscany, and so had been obliged to sell everything. Of course he
      wanted me to help him, but I turned a deaf ear to his entreaties.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have never seen this adventurer without his being in a desperate state
      of impecuniosity, but he would never learn to abate his luxurious habits,
      and always managed to find some way or other out of his difficulties. He
      was lucky enough to fall in with a Franciscan monk named De Dominis at
      Bologna, the said monk being on his way to Rome to solicit a brief of
      &lsquo;laicisation&rsquo; from the Pope. He fell in love with Medini&rsquo;s mistress, who
      naturally made him pay dearly for her charms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medini left at the end of three weeks. He went to Germany, where he
      printed his version of the &ldquo;Henriade,&rdquo; having discovered a Maecenas in the
      person of the Elector Palatin. After that he wandered about Europe for
      twelve years, and died in a London prison in 1788.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had always warned him to give England a wide berth, as I felt certain
      that if he once went there he would not escape English bolts and bars, and
      that if he got on the wrong side of the prison doors he would never come
      out alive. He despised my advice, and if he did so with the idea of
      proving me a liar, he made a mistake, for he proved me to be a prophet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medini had the advantage of high birth, a good education, and
      intelligence; but as he was a poor man with luxurious tastes he either
      corrected fortune at play or went into debt, and was consequently obliged
      to be always on the wing to avoid imprisonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived in this way for seventy years, and he might possibly be alive now
      if he had followed my advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight years ago Count Torio told me that he had seen Medini in a London
      prison, and that the silly fellow confessed he had only come to London
      with the hope of proving me to be a liar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medini&rsquo;s fate shall never prevent me from giving good advice to a poor
      wretch on the brink of the precipice. Twenty years ago I told Cagliostro
      (who called himself Count Pellegrini in those days) not to set his foot in
      Rome, and if he had followed this counsel he would not have died miserably
      in a Roman prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirty years ago a wise man advised me to beware visiting Spain. I went,
      but, as the reader knows, I had no reason to congratulate myself on my
      visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week after my arrival at Bologna, happening to be in the shop of
      Tartuffi, the bookseller, I made the acquaintance of a cross-eyed priest,
      who struck me, after a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s talk as a man of learning and
      talent. He presented me with two works which had recently been issued by
      two of the young professors at the university He told me that I should
      find them amusing reading, and he was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first treatise contended that women&rsquo;s faults should be forgiven them,
      since they were really the work of the matrix, which influenced them in
      spite of themselves. The second treatise was a criticism of the first. The
      author allowed that the uterus was an animal, but he denied the alleged
      influence, as no anatomist had succeeded in discovering any communication
      between it and the brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I determined to write a reply to the two pamphlets, and I did so in the
      course of three days. When my reply was finished I sent it to M. Dandolo,
      instructing him to have five hundred copies printed. When they arrived I
      gave a bookseller the agency, and in a fortnight I had made a hundred
      sequins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first pamphlet was called &ldquo;Lutero Pensante,&rdquo; the second was in French
      and bore the title &ldquo;La Force Vitale,&rdquo; while I called my reply &ldquo;Lana
      Caprina.&rdquo; I treated the matter in an easy vein, not without some hints of
      deep learning, and made fun of the lucubrations of the two physicians. My
      preface was in French, but full of Parisian idioms which rendered it
      unintelligible to all who had not visited the gay capital, and this
      circumstance gained me a good many friends amongst the younger generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squinting priest, whose name was Zacchierdi, introduced me to the Abbe
      Severini, who became my intimate friend in the course of ten or twelve
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      This abbe made me leave the inn, and got me two pleasant rooms in the
      house of a retired artiste, the widow of the tenor Carlani. He also made
      arrangements with a pastrycook to send me my dinner and supper. All this,
      plus a servant, only cost me ten sequins a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Severini was the agreeable cause of my losing temporarily my taste for
      study. I put by my &ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; feeling sure that I should be able to finish
      it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Severini introduced me to his family, and before long I became very
      intimate with him. I also became the favourite of his sister, a lady
      rather plain than pretty, thirty years old, but full of intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of Lent the abbe introduced me to all the best dancers and
      operatic singers in Bologna, which is the nursery of the heroines of the
      stage. They may be had cheaply enough on their native soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every week the good abbe introduced me to a fresh one, and like a true
      friend he watched carefully over my finances. He was a poor man himself,
      and could not afford to contribute anything towards the expenses of our
      little parties; but as they would have cost me double without his help,
      the arrangement was a convenient one for both of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time there was a good deal of talk about a Bolognese nobleman,
      Marquis Albergati Capacelli. He had made a present of his private theatre
      to the public, and was himself an excellent actor. He had made himself
      notorious by obtaining a divorce from his wife, whom he did not like, so
      as to enable him to marry a dancer, by whom he had two children. The
      amusing point in this divorce was that he obtained it on the plea that he
      was impotent, and sustained his plea by submitting to an examination,
      which was conducted as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Four skilled and impartial judges had the marquis stripped before them,
      and did all in their power to produce an erection; but somehow or other he
      succeeded in maintaining his composure, and the marriage was pronounced
      null and void on the ground of relative impotence, for it was well known
      that he had had children by another woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      If reason and not prejudice had been consulted, the procedure would have
      been very different; for if relative impotence was considered a sufficient
      ground for divorce, of what use was the examination?
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis should have sworn that he could do nothing with his wife, and
      if the lady had traversed this statement the marquis might have challenged
      her to put him into the required condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the destruction of old customs and old prejudices is often the work of
      long ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt curious to know this character, and wrote to M. Dandolo to get me a
      letter of introduction to the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a week my good old friend sent me the desired letter. It was written by
      another Venetian, M. de Zaguri, an intimate friend of the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was not sealed, so I read it. I was delighted; no one could
      have commended a person unknown to himself but the friend of a friend in a
      more delicate manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought myself bound to write a letter of thanks to M. Zaguri. I said
      that I desired to obtain my pardon more than ever after reading his
      letter, which made me long to go to Venice, and make the acquaintance of
      such a worthy nobleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not expect an answer, but I got one. M. Zaguri said that my desire
      was such a flattering one to himself, that he meant to do his best to
      obtain my recall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader will see that he was successful, but not till after two years
      of continuous effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albergati was away from Bologna at the time, but when he returned Severini
      let me know, and I called at the palace. The porter told me that his
      excellence (all the nobles are excellences at Bologna) had gone to his
      country house, where he meant to pass the whole of the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      In two or three days I drove out to his villa. I arrived at a charming
      mansion, and finding no one at the door I went upstairs, and entered a
      large room where a gentleman and an exceedingly pretty woman were just
      sitting down to dinner. The dishes had been brought in, and there were
      only two places laid.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made a polite bow, and asked the gentleman if I had the honour of
      addressing the Marquis Albergati. He replied in the affirmative, whereupon
      I gave him my letter of introduction. He took it, read the superscription,
      and put it in his pocket, telling me I was very kind to have taken so much
      trouble, and that he would be sure to read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been no trouble at all,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but I hope you will read the
      letter. It is written by M. de Zaguri, whom I asked to do me this service,
      as I have long desired to make your lordship&rsquo;s acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lordship smiled and said very pleasantly that he would read it after
      dinner, and would see what he could do for his friend Zaguri.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our dialogue was over in a few seconds. Thinking him extremely rude I
      turned my back and went downstairs, arriving just in time to prevent the
      postillion taking out the horses. I promised him a double gratuity if he
      would take me to some village at hand, where he could bait his horses
      while I breakfasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the postillion had got on horseback a servant came running up. He
      told me very politely that his excellence begged me to step upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I put my hand in my pocket and gave the man my card with my name and
      address, and telling him that that was what his master wanted, I ordered
      the postillion to drive off at a full gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had gone half a league we stopped at a good inn, and then
      proceeded on our way back to Bologna.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same day I wrote to M. de Zaguri, and described the welcome I had
      received at the hands of the marquis. I enclosed the letter in another to
      M. Dandolo, begging him to read it, and to send it on. I begged the noble
      Venetian to write to the marquis that having offended me grievously he
      must prepare to give me due satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed with all my heart next day when my landlady gave me a visiting
      card with the inscription, General the Marquis of Albergati. She told me
      the marquis had called on me himself, and on hearing I was out had left
      his card.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to look upon the whole of his proceedings as pure gasconnade, only
      lacking the wit of the true Gascon. I determined to await M. Zaguri&rsquo;s
      reply before making up my mind as to the kind of satisfaction I should
      demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was inspecting the card, and wondering what right the marquis had
      to the title of general, Severini came in, and informed me that the
      marquis had been made a Knight of the Order of St. Stanislas by the King
      of Poland, who had also given him the style of royal chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he a general in the Polish service as well?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand it all,&rdquo; I said to myself. &ldquo;In Poland a chamberlain has the
      rank of adjutant-general, and the marquis calls himself general. But
      general what? The adjective without a substantive is a mere cheat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw my opportunity, and wrote a comic dialogue, which I had printed the
      next day. I made a present of the work to a bookseller, and in three or
      four days he sold out the whole edition at a bajocco apiece.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Farinello and the Electress Dowager of Saxony&mdash;Madame
     Slopitz&mdash;Nina&mdash;The Midwife&mdash;Madame Soavi&mdash;Abbe Bolini&mdash;

</pre>
    <p>
      Anyone who attacks a proud person in a comic vein is almost sure of
      success; the laugh is generally on his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked in my dialogue whether it was lawful for a provost-marshal to call
      himself simply marshal, and whether a lieutenant-colonel had a right to
      the title of colonel. I also asked whether the man who preferred titles of
      honour, for which he had paid in hard cash, to his ancient and legitimate
      rank, could pass for a sage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the marquis had to laugh at my dialogue, but he was called the
      general ever after. He had placed the royal arms of Poland over the gate
      of his palace, much to the amusement of Count Mischinski, the Polish
      ambassador to Berlin, who happened to be passing through Bologna at that
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told the Pole of my dispute with the mad marquis, and persuaded him to
      pay Albergati a visit, leaving his card. The ambassador did so, and the
      call was returned, but Albergati&rsquo;s cards no longer bore the title of
      general.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dowager Electress of Saxony having come to Bologna, I hastened to pay
      my respects to her. She had only come to see the famous castrato
      Farinello, who had left Madrid, and now lived at Bologna in great comfort.
      He placed a magnificent collation before the Electress, and sang a song of
      his own composition, accompanying himself on the piano. The Electress, who
      was an enthusiastic musician, embraced Farinello, exclaiming,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I can die happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Farinello, who was also known as the Chevalier Borschi had reigned, as it
      were, in Spain till the Parmese wife of Philip V. had laid plots which
      obliged him to leave the Court after the disgrace of Enunada. The
      Electress noticed a portrait of the queen, and spoke very highly of her,
      mentioning some circumstances which must have taken place in the reign of
      Ferdinand VI.
    </p>
    <p>
      The famous musician burst into tears, and said that Queen Barbara was as
      good as Elizabeth of Parma was wicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Borschi might have been seventy when I saw him at Bologna. He was very
      rich and in the enjoyment of good health, and yet he was unhappy,
      continually shedding tears at the thought of Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ambition is a more powerful passion than avarice. Besides, Farinello had
      another reason for unhappiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a nephew who was the heir to all his wealth, whom he married to a
      noble Tuscan lady, hoping to found a titled family, though in an indirect
      kind of way. But this marriage was a torment to him, for in his impotent
      old age he was so unfortunate as to fall in love with his niece, and to
      become jealous of his nephew. Worse than all the lady grew to hate him,
      and Farinello had sent his nephew abroad, while he never allowed the wife
      to go out of his sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lincoln arrived in Bologna with an introduction for the cardinal
      legate, who asked him to dinner, and did me the honour of giving me an
      invitation to meet him. The cardinal was thus convinced that Lord Lincoln
      and I had never met, and that the grand duke of Tuscany had committed a
      great injustice in banishing me. It was on that occasion that the young
      nobleman told me how they had spread the snare, though he denied that he
      had been cheated; he was far too proud to acknowledge such a thing. He
      died of debauchery in London three or four years after.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also saw at Bologna the Englishman Aston with Madame Slopitz, sister of
      the Charming Caillimena. Madame Slopitz was much handsomer than her sister.
      She had presented Aston with two babes as beautiful as Raphael&rsquo;s cherubs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spoke of her sister to her, and from the way in which I sang her praises
      she guessed that I had loved her. She told me she would be in Florence
      during the Carnival of 1773, but I did not see her again till the year
      1776, when I was at Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dreadful Nina Bergonci, who had made a madman of Count Ricla, and was
      the source of all my woes at Barcelona, had come to Bologna at the
      beginning of Lent, occupying a pleasant house which she had taken. She had
      carte blanche with a banker, and kept up a great state, affirming herself
      to be with child by the Viceroy of Catalonia, and demanding the honours
      which would be given to a queen who had graciously chosen Bologna as the
      place of her confinement. She had a special recommendation to the legate,
      who often visited her, but in the greatest secrecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time of her confinement approached, and the insane Ricla sent over a
      confidential man, Don Martino, who was empowered to have the child
      baptized, and to recognize it as Ricla&rsquo;s natural offspring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nina made a show of her condition, appearing at the theatre and in the
      public places with an enormous belly. The greatest noble of Bologna paid
      court to her, and Nina told them that they might do so, but that she could
      not guarantee their safety from the jealous dagger of Ricla. She was
      impudent enough to tell them what happened to me at Barcelona, not knowing
      that I was at Bologna.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was extremely surprised to hear from Count Zini, who knew me, that I
      inhabited the same town as herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the count met me he asked me if the Barcelona story was true. I did
      not care to take him into my confidence, so I replied that I did not know
      Nina, and that the story had doubtless been made up by her to see whether
      he would encounter danger for her sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I met the cardinal I told him the whole story, and his eminence was
      astonished when I gave him some insight into Nina&rsquo;s character, and
      informed him that she was the daughter of her sister and her grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could stake my life,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that Nina is no more with child than you
      are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come!&rdquo; said he, laughing, &ldquo;that is really too strong; why shouldn&rsquo;t
      she have a child? It is a very simple matter, it seems to me. Possibly it
      may not be Ricla&rsquo;s child but there can be no doubt that she is with
      somebody&rsquo;s child. What object could she have for feigning pregnancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make herself famous by defiling the Count de Ricla, who was a model of
      justice and virtue before knowing this Messalina. If your eminence knew
      the hideous character of Nina you would not wonder at anything she did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About a week later I heard a great noise in the street, and on putting my
      head out of the window I saw a woman stripped to the waist, and mounted on
      an ass, being scourged by the hangman, and hooted by a mob of all the
      biricchini in Bologna. Severini came up at the same moment and informed me
      that the woman was the chief midwife in Bologna, and that her punishment
      had been ordered by the cardinal archbishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be for some great crime,&rdquo; I observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt. It is the woman who was with Nina the day before yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! has Nina been brought to bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but of a still-born child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day the story was all over the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      A poor woman had come before the archbishop, and had complained bitterly
      that the midwife Teresa had seduced her, promising to give her twenty
      sequins if she would give her a fine boy to whom she had given birth a
      fortnight ago. She was not given the sum agreed upon, and in her despair
      at hearing of the death of her child she begged for justice, declaring
      herself able to prove that the dead child said to be Nina&rsquo;s was in reality
      her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The archbishop ordered his chancellor to enquire into the affair with the
      utmost secrecy, and then proceed to instant and summary execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week after this scandal Don Martino returned to Barcelona; but Nina
      remained as impudent as ever, doubled the size of the red cockades which
      she made her servants wear, and swore that Spain would avenge her on the
      insolent archbishop. She remained at Bologna six weeks longer, pretending
      to be still suffering from the effects of her confinement. The cardinal
      legate, who was ashamed of having had anything to do with such an
      abandoned prostitute, did his best to have her ordered to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Ricla, a dupe to the last, gave her a considerable yearly income on
      the condition that she should never come to Barcelona again; but in a year
      the count died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nina did not survive him for more than a year, and died miserably from her
      fearful debauchery. I met her mother and sister at Venice, and she told me
      the story of the last two years of her daughter&rsquo;s life; but it is so sad
      and so disgusting a tale that I feel obliged to omit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the infamous midwife, she found powerful friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pamphlet appeared in which the anonymous author declared that the
      archbishop had committed a great wrong in punishing a citizen in so
      shameful a manner without any of the proper formalities of justice. The
      writer maintained that even if she were guilty she had been unjustly
      punished, and should appeal to Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prelate, feeling the force of these animadversions, circulated a
      pamphlet in which it appeared that the midwife had made three prior
      appearances before the judge, and that she would have been sent to the
      gallows long ago if the archbishop had not hesitated to shame three of the
      noblest families in Bologna, whose names appeared in documents in the
      custody of his chancellor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her crimes were procuring abortion and killing erring mothers,
      substituting the living for the dead, and in one case a boy for a girl,
      thus giving him the enjoyment of property which did not belong to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This pamphlet of the prelate reduced the patrons of the infamous midwife
      to silence, for several young noblemen whose mothers had been attended by
      her did not relish the idea of their family secrets being brought to
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Bologna I saw Madame Marucci, who had been expelled from Spain for the
      same reason as Madame Pelliccia. The latter had retired to Rome, while
      Madame Marucci was on her way to Lucca, her native country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Soavi, a Bolognese dancer whom I had known at Parma and Paris, came
      to Bologna with her daughter by M. de Marigni. The girl, whose name was
      Adelaide, was very beautiful, and her natural abilities had been fostered
      by a careful education.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Madame Soavi got to Bologna she met her husband whom she had not seen
      for fifteen years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a treasure for you,&rdquo; said she, shewing him her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s certainly very pretty, but what am I to do with her? She does not
      belong to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes she does, as I have given her to you. You must know that she has six
      thousand francs a year, and that I shall be her cashier till I get her
      married to a good dancer. I want her to learn character dancing, and to
      make her appearance on the boards. You must take her out on holidays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I say if people ask me who she is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say she is your daughter, and that you are certain, because your wife
      gave her to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you have always stayed at home, and consequently your wits are
      homely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I heard this curious dialogue which made me laugh then, and makes me laugh
      now as I write it. I offered to help in Adelaide&rsquo;s education, but Madame
      Soavi laughed, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fox, you have deceived so many tender pullets, that I don&rsquo;t like to trust
      you with this one, for fear of your making her too precocious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not think of that, but you are right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adelaide became the wonder of Bologna.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year after I left the Comte du Barri, brother-in-law of the famous
      mistress of Louis XV., visited Bologna, and became so amorous of Adelaide
      that her mother sent her away, fearing he would carry her off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Du Barri offered her a hundred thousand francs for the girl, but she
      refused the offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw Adelaide five years later on the boards of a Venetian theatre. When
      I went to congratulate her, she said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother brought me into the world, and I think she will send me out of
      it; this dancing is killing me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In point of fact this delicate flower faded and died after seven years of
      the severe life to which her mother had exposed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Soavi who had not taken the precaution to settle the six thousand
      francs on herself, lost all in losing Adelaide, and died miserably after
      having rolled in riches. But, alas! I am not the man to reproach anyone on
      the score of imprudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Bologna I met the famous Afflisio, who had been discharged from the
      imperial service and had turned manager. He went from bad to worse, and
      five or six years later committed forgery, was sent to the galleys, and
      there died.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was also impressed by the example of a man of a good family, who had
      once been rich. This was Count Filomarino. He was living in great misery,
      deprived of the use of all his limbs by a succession of venereal
      complaints. I often went to see him to give him a few pieces of money, and
      to listen to his malevolent talk, for his tongue was the only member that
      continued active. He was a scoundrel and a slanderer, and writhed under
      the thought that he could not go to Naples and torment his relations, who
      were in reality respectable people, but monsters according to his shewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Sabatini, the dancer, had returned to Bologna, having made enough
      money to rest upon her laurels. She married a professor of anatomy, and
      brought all her wealth to him as a dower. She had with her her sister, who
      was not rich and had no talents, but was at the same time very agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the house I met an abbe, a fine young man of modest appearance. The
      sister seemed to be deeply in love with him, while he appeared to be
      grateful and nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made some remark to the modest Adonis, and he gave me a very sensible
      answer. We walked away together, and after telling each other what brought
      us to Bologna we parted, agreeing to meet again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abbe, who was twenty-four or twenty-five years old, was not in orders,
      and was the only son of a noble family of Novara, which was unfortunately
      poor as well as noble.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a very scanty revenue, and was able to live more cheaply at Bologna
      than Novara, where everything is dear. Besides, he did not care for his
      relations; he had no friends, and everybody there was more or less
      ignorant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe de Bolini, as he was called, was a man of tranquil mind, living a
      peaceful and quiet life above all things. He liked lettered men more than
      letters, and did not trouble to gain the reputation of a wit. He knew he
      was not a fool, and when he mixed with learned men he was quite clever
      enough to be a good listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both temperament and his purse made him temperate in all things, and he
      had received a sound Christian education. He never talked about religion,
      but nothing scandalized him. He seldom praised and never blamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was almost entirely indifferent to women, flying from ugly women and
      blue stockings, and gratifying the passion of pretty ones more out of
      kindliness than love, for in his heart he considered women as more likely
      to make a man miserable than happy. I was especially interested in this
      last characteristic.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had been friends for three weeks when I took the liberty of asking him
      how he reconciled his theories with his attachment to Brigida Sabatini.
    </p>
    <p>
      He supped with her every evening, and she breakfasted with him every
      morning. When I went to see him, she was either there already or came in
      before my call was over. She breathed forth love in every glance, while
      the abbe was kind, but, in spite of his politeness, evidently bored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brigida looked well enough, but she was at least ten years older than the
      abbe. She was very polite to me and did her best to convince me that the
      abbe was happy in the possession of her heart, and that they both enjoyed
      the delights of mutual love.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when I asked him over a bottle of good wine about his affection for
      Brigida, he sighed, smiled, blushed, looked down, and finally confessed
      that this connection was the misfortune of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Misfortune? Does she make you sigh in vain? If so you should leave her,
      and thus regain your happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I sigh? I am not in love with her. She is in love with me, and
      tries to make me her slave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants me to marry her, and I promised to do so, partly from weakness,
      and partly from pity; and now she is in a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay; all these elderly girls are in a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every evening she treats me to tears, supplications, and despair. She
      summons me to keep my promise, and accuses me of deceiving her, so you may
      imagine that my situation is an unhappy one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any obligations towards her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever. She has violated me, so to speak, for all the advances
      came from her. She has only what her sister gives her from day to day, and
      if she got married she would not get that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got her with child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have taken good care not to do so, and that&rsquo;s what has irritated her;
      she calls all my little stratagems detestable treason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, you have made up your mind to marry her sooner or later?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d as soon hang myself. If I got married to her I should be four times
      as poor as I am now, and all my relations at Novara would laugh at me for
      bringing home a wife of her age. Besides, she is neither rich nor well
      born, and at Novara they demand the one or the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then as a man of honour and as a man of sense, you ought to break with
      her, and the sooner the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, but lacking normal strength what am I to do? If I did not go and
      sup with her to-night, she would infallibly come after me to see what had
      happened. I can&rsquo;t lock my door in her face, and I can&rsquo;t tell her to go
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but neither can I go on in this miserable way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must make up your mind, and cut the Gordian knot, like Alexander.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t his sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will lend it you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me. You must go and live in another town. She will hardly go
      after you there, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a very good plan, but flight is a difficult matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Difficult? Not at all. Do you promise to do what I tell you, and I will
      arrange everything quite comfortably. Your mistress will not know anything
      about it till she misses you at supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do whatever you tell me, and I shall never forget your kindness;
      but Brigida will go mad with grief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well my first order to you is not to give her grief a single thought. You
      have only to leave everything to me. Would you like to start to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Have you any debts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want any money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sufficient. But the idea of leaving tomorrow has taken my breath
      away. I must have three days delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect some letters the day after to-morrow, and I must write to my
      relations to tell them where I am going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take charge of your letters and send them on to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall I be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you at the moment of your departure; trust in me. I will send
      you at once where you will be comfortable. All you have to do is to leave
      your trunk in the hands of your landlord, with orders not to give it up to
      anyone but myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. I am to go without my trunk, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You must dine with me every day till you go, and mind not to tell
      anyone whatsoever that you intend leaving Bologna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take care not to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The worthy young fellow looked quite radiant. I embraced him and thanked
      him for putting so much trust in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt proud at the good work I was about to perform, and smiled at the
      thought of Brigida&rsquo;s anger when she found that her lover had escaped. I
      wrote to my good friend Dandolo that in five or six days a young abbe
      would present himself before him bearing a letter from myself. I begged
      Dandolo to get him a comfortable and cheap lodging, as my friend was so
      unfortunate as to be indifferently provided with money, though an
      excellent man. I then wrote the letter of which the abbe was to be the
      bearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day Bolini told me that Brigida was far from suspecting his flight,
      as owing to his gaiety at the thought of freedom he had contented her so
      well during the night she had passed with him that she thought him as much
      in love as she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has all my linen,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;but I hope to get a good part of it
      back under one pretext or another, and she is welcome to the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the day appointed he called on me as we had arranged the night before,
      carrying a huge carpet bag containing necessaries. I took him to Modena in
      a post chaise, and there we dined; afterward I gave him a letter for M.
      Dandolo, promising to send on his trunk the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was delighted to hear that Venice was his destination, as he had long
      wished to go there, and I promised him that M. Dandolo should see that he
      lived as comfortably and cheaply as he had done at Bologna.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw him off, and returned to Bologna. The trunk I dispatched after him
      the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I had expected, the poor victim appeared before me all in tears the
      next day. I felt it my duty to pity her; it would have been cruel to
      pretend I did not know the reason for her despair. I gave her a long but
      kindly sermon, endeavouring to persuade her that I had acted for the best
      in preventing the abbe marrying her, as such a step would have plunged
      them both into misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman threw herself weeping at my feet, begging me to bring her
      abbe back, and swearing by all the saints that she would never mention the
      word &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; again. By way of calming her, I said I would do my best to
      win him over.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked where he was, and I said at Venice; but of course she did not
      believe me. There are circumstances when a clever man deceives by telling
      the truth, and such a lie as this must be approved by the most rigorous
      moralists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty-seven months later I met Bolini at Venice. I shall describe the
      meeting in its proper place.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after he had gone, I made the acquaintance of the fair
      Viscioletta, and fell so ardently in love with her that I had to make up
      my mind to buy her with hard cash. The time when I could make women fall
      in love with me was no more, and I had to make up my mind either to do
      without them or to buy them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot help laughing when people ask me for advice, as I feel so certain
      that my advice will not be taken. Man is an animal that has to learn his
      lesson by hard experience in battling with the storms of life. Thus the
      world is always in disorder and always ignorant, for those who know are
      always in an infinitesimal proportion to the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Viscioletta, whom I went to see every day, treated me as the
      Florentine widow had done, though the widow required forms and ceremonies
      which I could dispense with in the presence of the fair Viscioletta, who
      was nothing else than a professional courtezan, though she called herself
      a virtuosa.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had besieged her for three weeks without any success, and when I made
      any attempts she repulsed me laughingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsignor Buoncompagni, the vice-legate, was her lover in secret, though
      all the town knew it, but this sort of conventional secrecy is common
      enough in Italy. As as ecclesiastic he could not court her openly, but the
      hussy made no mystery whatever of his visits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being in need of money, and preferring to get rid of my carriage than of
      anything else, I announced it for sale at the price of three hundred and
      fifty Roman crowns. It was a comfortable and handsome carriage, and was
      well worth the price. I was told that the vice-legate offered three
      hundred crowns, and I felt a real pleasure in contradicting my favoured
      rival&rsquo;s desires. I told the man that I had stated my price and meant to
      adhere to it, as I was not accustomed to bargaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to see my carriage at noon one day to make sure that it was in good
      condition, and met the vice-legate who knew me from meeting me at the
      legate&rsquo;s, and must have been aware that I was poaching on his preserves.
      He told me rudely that the carriage was not worth more than three hundred
      crowns, and that I ought to be glad of the opportunity of getting rid of
      it, as it was much too good for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the strength of mind to despise his violence, and telling him dryly
      that I did not chaffer I turned my back on him and went my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day the fair Viscioletta wrote me a note to the effect that she would
      be very much obliged if I would let the vice-legate have the carriage at
      his own price, as she felt sure he would give it to her. I replied that I
      would call on her in the afternoon, and that my answer would depend on my
      welcome, I went in due course, and after a lively discussion, she gave
      way, and I signified my willingness to sell the carriage for the sum
      offered by the vice-legate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day she had her carriage, and I had my three hundred crowns, and
      I let the proud prelate understand that I had avenged myself for his
      rudeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time Severini succeeded in obtaining a position as tutor in an
      illustrious Neapolitan family, and as soon as he received his
      journey-money he left Bologna. I also had thoughts of leaving the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had kept up an interesting correspondence with M. Zaguri, who had made
      up his mind to obtain my recall in concert with Dandolo, who desired
      nothing better. Zaguri told me that if I wanted to obtain my pardon I must
      come and live as near as possible to the Venetian borders, so that the
      State Inquisitors might satisfy themselves of my good conduct. M. Zuliani,
      brother to the Duchess of Fiano, gave me the same advice, and promised to
      use all his interest in my behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the idea of following this counsel I decided to set up my abode at
      Trieste, where M. Zaguri told me he had an intimate friend to whom he
      would give me a letter of introduction. As I could not go by land without
      passing through the States of Venice I resolved to go to Ancona, whence
      boats sail to Trieste every day. As I should pass through Pesaro I asked
      my patron to give me a letter for the Marquis Mosca, a distinguished man
      of letters whom I had long wished to know. Just then he was a good deal
      talked about on account of a treatise on alms which he had recently
      published, and which the Roman curia had placed on the &ldquo;Index.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marquis was a devotee as well as a man of learning, and was imbued
      with the doctrine of St. Augustine, which becomes Jansenism if pushed to
      an extreme point.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sorry to leave Bologna, for I had spent eight pleasant months there.
      In two days I arrived at Pesaro in perfect health and well provided for in
      every way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left my letter with the marquis, and he came to see me the same day. He
      said his house would always be open to me, and that he would leave me in
      his wife&rsquo;s hands to be introduced to everybody and everything in the
      place. He ended by asking me to dine with him the following day, adding
      that if I cared to examine his library he could give me an excellent cup
      of chocolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went, and saw an enormous collection of comments on the Latin poets from
      Ennius to the poets of the twelfth century of our era. He had had them all
      printed at his own expense and at his private press, in four tall folios,
      very accurately printed but without elegance. I told him my opinion, and
      he agreed that I was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The want of elegance which had spared him an outlay of a hundred thousand
      francs had deprived him of a profit of three hundred thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He presented me with a copy, which he sent to my inn, with an immense
      folio volume entitled &ldquo;Marmora Pisaurentia,&rdquo; which I had no time to
      examine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was much pleased with the marchioness, who had three daughters and two
      sons, all good-looking and well bred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness was a woman of the world, while her husband&rsquo;s interests
      were confined to his books. This difference in disposition sometimes gave
      rise to a slight element of discord, but a stranger would never have
      noticed it if he had not been told.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifty years ago a wise man said to me: &ldquo;Every family is troubled by some
      small tragedy, which should be kept private with the greatest care. In
      fine, people should learn to wash their dirty linen in private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness paid me great attention during the five days I spent at
      Pesaro. In the day she drove me from one country house to another, and at
      night she introduced me to all the nobility of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis might have been fifty then. He was cold by temperament, had no
      other passion but that of study, and his morals were pure. He had founded
      an academy of which he was the president. Its design was a fly, in
      allusion to his name Mosca, with the words &lsquo;de me ce&rsquo;, that is to say,
      take away &lsquo;c&rsquo; from &lsquo;musca&rsquo; and you have &lsquo;musa&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      His only failing was that which the monks regard as his finest quality, he
      was religious to excess, and this excess of religion went beyond the
      bounds where &lsquo;nequit consistere rectum&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      But which is the better, to go beyond these bounds, or not to come up to
      them? I cannot venture to decide the question. Horace says,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;Nulla est mihi religio!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and it is the beginning of an ode in which he condemns philosophy for
      estranging him from religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excess of every kind is bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left Pesaro delighted with the good company I had met, and only sorry I
      had not seen the marquis&rsquo;s brother who was praised by everyone.

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     A Jew Named Mardocheus Becomes My Travelling Companion&mdash;
     He Persuades Me to Lodge in His House&mdash;I Fall in Love With His
     Daughter Leah&mdash;After a Stay of Six Weeks I Go to Trieste
</pre>
    <p>
      Some time elapsed before I had time to examine the Marquis of Mosca&rsquo;s
      collection of Latin poets, amongst which the &lsquo;Priapeia&rsquo; found no place.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt this work bore witness to his love for literature but not to his
      learning, for there was nothing of his own in it. All he had done was to
      classify each fragment in chronological order. I should have liked to see
      notes, comments, explanations, and such like; but there was nothing of the
      kind. Besides, the type was not elegant, the margins were poor, the paper
      common, and misprints not infrequent. All these are bad faults, especially
      in a work which should have become a classic. Consequently, the book was
      not a profitable one; and as the marquis was not a rich man he was
      occasionally reproached by his wife for the money he had expended.
    </p>
    <p>
      I read his treatise on almsgiving and his apology for it, and understood a
      good deal of the marquis&rsquo;s way of thinking. I could easily imagine that
      his writings must have given great offence at Rome, and that with sounder
      judgment he would have avoided this danger. Of course the marquis was
      really in the right, but in theology one is only in the right when Rome
      says yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis was a rigorist, and though he had a tincture of Jansenism he
      often differed from St. Augustine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He denied, for instance, that almsgiving could annul the penalty attached
      to sin, and according to him the only sort of almsgiving which had any
      merit was that prescribed in the Gospel: &ldquo;Let not thy right hand know what
      thy left hand doeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He even maintained that he who gave alms sinned unless it was done with
      the greatest secrecy, for alms given in public are sure to be accompanied
      by vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have been objected that the merit of alms lies in the intention
      with which they are given. It is quite possible for a good man to slip a
      piece of money into the palm of some miserable being standing in a public
      place, and yet this may be done solely with the idea of relieving distress
      without a thought of the onlookers.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I wanted to go to Trieste, I might have crossed the gulf by a small
      boat from Pesaro; a good wind was blowing, and I should have got to
      Trieste in twelve hours. This was my proper way, for I had nothing to do
      at Ancona, and it was a hundred miles longer; but I had said I would go by
      Ancona, and I felt obliged to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had always a strong tincture of superstition, which has exercised
      considerable influence on my strange career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Socrates I, too, had a demon to whom I referred my doubtful counsels,
      doing his will, and obeying blindly when I felt a voice within me telling
      me to forbear.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred times have I thus followed my genius, and occasionally I have
      felt inclined to complain that it did not impel me to act against my
      reason more frequently. Whenever I did so I found that impulse was right
      and reason wrong, and for all that I have still continued reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I arrived at Senegallia, at three stages from Ancona, my vetturino
      asked me, just as I was going to bed, whether I would allow him to
      accommodate a Jew who was going to Ancona in the chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first impulse made me answer sharply that I wanted no one in my chaise,
      much less a Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vetturino went out, but a voice said within me, &ldquo;You must take this
      poor Israelite;&rdquo; and in spite of my repugnance I called back the man and
      signified my assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must make up your mind to start at an earlier hour, for it is
      Friday to-morrow, and you know the Jews are not allowed to travel after
      sunset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not start a moment earlier than I intended, but you can make your
      horses travel as quickly as you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave me no answer, and went out. The next morning I found my Jew, an
      honest-looking fellow, in the carriage. The first thing he asked me was
      why I did not like Jews.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because your religion teaches you to hate men of all other religions,
      especially Christians, and you think you have done a meritorious action
      when you have deceived us. You do not look upon us as brothers. You are
      usurious, unmerciful, our enemies, and so I do not like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, sir. Come with me to our synagogue this evening, and
      you will hear us pray for all Christians, beginning with our Lord the
      Pope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not help bursting into a roar of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but the prayer comes from the mouth only, and not from
      the heart. If you do not immediately confess that the Jews would not pray
      for the Christians if they were the masters, I will fling you out of the
      chaise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course I did not carry out this threat, but I completed his confusion
      by quoting in Hebrew the passages in the Old Testament, where the Jews are
      bidden to do all possible harm to the Gentiles, whom they were to curse
      every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this the poor man said no more. When we were going to take our
      dinner I asked him to sit beside me, but he said his religion would not
      allow him to do so, and that he would only eat eggs, fruit, and some
      foiegras sausage he had in his pocket. He only drank water because he was
      not sure that the wine was unadulterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stupid fellow,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;how can you ever be certain of the
      purity of wine unless you have made it yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we were on our way again he said that if I liked to come and stay
      with him, and to content myself with such dishes as God had not forbidden,
      he would make me more comfortable than if I went to the inn, and at a
      cheaper rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you let lodgings to Christians?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t let lodgings to anybody, but I will make an exception in your
      case to disabuse you of some of your mistaken notions. I will only ask you
      six paoli a day, and give you two good meals without wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must give me fish and wine, I paying for them as extras.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; I have a Christian cook, and my wife pays a good deal of
      attention to the cooking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can give me the foie gras every day, if you will eat it with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you think, but you shall be satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I got down at the Jew&rsquo;s house, wondering at myself as I did so. However, I
      knew that if I did not like my accommodation I could leave the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife and children were waiting for him, and gave him a joyful welcome
      in honour of the Sabbath. All servile work was forbidden on this day holy
      to the Lord; and all over the house, and in the face of all the family, I
      observed a kind of festal air.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was welcomed like a brother, and I replied as best I could; but a word
      from Mardocheus (so he was called) changed their politeness of feeling
      into a politeness of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mardocheus shewed me two rooms for me to choose the one which suited me,
      but liking them both I said I would take the two for another paolo a day,
      with which arrangement he was well enough pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mardocheus told his wife what we had settled, and she instructed the
      Christian servant to cook my supper for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had my effects taken upstairs, and then went with Mardocheus to the
      synagogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the short service the Jews paid no attention to me or to several
      other Christians who were present. The Jews go to the synagogue to pray,
      and in this respect I think their conduct worthy of imitation by the
      Christians.
    </p>
    <p>
      On leaving the synagogue I went by myself to the Exchange, thinking over
      the happy time which would never return.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in Ancona that I had begun to enjoy life; and when I thought it
      over, it was quite a shock to find that this was thirty years ago, for
      thirty years is a long period in a man&rsquo;s life. And yet I felt quite happy,
      in spite of the tenth lustrum so near at hand for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a difference I found between my youth and my middle age! I could
      scarcely recognize myself. I was then happy, but now unhappy; then all the
      world was before me, and the future seemed a gorgeous dream, and now I was
      obliged to confess that my life had been all in vain. I might live twenty
      years more, but I felt that the happy time was passed away, and the future
      seemed all dreary.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reckoned up my forty-seven years, and saw fortune fly away. This in
      itself was enough to sadden me, for without the favours of the fickle
      goddess life was not worth living, for me at all events.
    </p>
    <p>
      My object, then, was to return to my country; it was as if I struggled to
      undo all that I had done. All I could hope for was to soften the hardships
      of the slow but certain passage to the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are the thoughts of declining years and not of youth. The young man
      looks only to the present, believes that the sky will always smile upon
      him, and laughs at philosophy as it vainly preaches of old age, misery,
      repentance, and, worst of all, abhorred death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were my thoughts twenty-six years ago; what must they be now, when I
      am all alone, poor, despised, and impotent. They would kill me if I did
      not resolutely subdue them, for whether for good or ill my heart is still
      young. Of what use are desires when one can no longer satisfy them? I
      write to kill ennui, and I take a pleasure in writing. Whether I write
      sense or nonsense, what matters? I am amused, and that is enough.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;Malo scriptor delirus, inersque videri,
   Dum mea delectent mala me vel denique fallunt,
   Quam sapere.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      When I came back I found Mardocheus at supper with his numerous family,
      composed of eleven or twelve individuals, and including his mother&mdash;an
      old woman of ninety, who looked very well. I noticed another Jew of middle
      age; he was the husband of his eldest daughter, who did not strike me as
      pretty; but the younger daughter, who was destined for a Jew of Pesaro,
      whom she had never seen, engaged all my attention. I remarked to her that
      if she had not seen her future husband she could not be in love with him,
      whereupon she replied in a serious voice that it was not necessary to be
      in love before one married. The old woman praised the girl for this
      sentiment, and said she had not been in love with her husband till the
      first child was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall call the pretty Jewess Leah, as I have good reasons for not using
      her real name.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were enjoying their meal I sat down beside her and tried to
      make myself as agreeable as possible, but she would not even look at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My supper was excellent, and my bed very comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day my landlord told me that I could give my linen to the maid,
      and that Leah could get it up for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him I had relished my supper, but that I should like the foie gras
      every day as I had a dispensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have some to-morrow, but Leah is the only one of us who eats
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Leah must take it with me, and you can tell her that I shall give
      her some Cyprus wine which is perfectly pure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had no wine, but I went for it the same morning to the Venetian consul,
      giving him M. Dandolo&rsquo;s letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consul was a Venetian of the old leaven. He had heard my name, and
      seemed delighted to make my acquaintance. He was a kind of clown without
      the paint, fond of a joke, a regular gourmand, and a man of great
      experience. He sold me some Scopolo and old Cyprus Muscat, but he began to
      exclaim when he heard where I was lodging, and how I had come there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is rich,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but he is also a great usurer, and if you borrow
      money of him he will make you repent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After informing the consul that I should not leave till the end of the
      month, I went home to dinner, which proved excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I gave out my linen to the maid, and Leah came to ask me how
      I liked my lace got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Leah had examined me more closely she would have seen that the sight of
      her magnificent breast, unprotected by any kerchief, had had a remarkable
      effect on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her that I left it all to her, and that she could do what she liked
      with the linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it will all come under my hands if you are in no hurry to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can make me stay as long as you like,&rdquo; said I; but she seemed not to
      hear this declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is quite right,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;except the chocolate; I like it
      well frothed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will make it for you myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will give out a double quantity, and we will take it together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like chocolate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to hear that; but you like foie gras?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do; and from what father tells me I am going to take some with you
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are afraid of being poisoned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; I only wish we could die together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pretended not to understand, and left me burning with desire. I felt
      that I must either obtain possession of her or tell her father not to send
      her into my room any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Turin Jewess had given me some valuable hints as to the conduct of
      amours with Jewish girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      My theory was that Leah would be more easily won than she, for at Ancona
      there was much more liberty than at Turin.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a rake&rsquo;s reasoning, but even rakes are mistaken sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner that was served to me was very good, though cooked in the
      Jewish style, and Leah brought in the foie gras and sat down opposite to
      me with a muslin kerchief over her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foie gras was excellent, and we washed it down with copious libations
      of Scopolo, which Leah found very much to her taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the foie gras was finished she got up, but I stopped her, for the
      dinner was only half over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will stay then,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but I am afraid my father will object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Call your master,&rdquo; I said to the maid who came in at that
      moment, &ldquo;I have a word to speak to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mardocheus,&rdquo; I said when he came, &ldquo;your daughter&rsquo;s appetite
      doubles mine, and I shall be much obliged if you will allow her to keep me
      company whenever we have foie gras.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t to my profit to double your appetite, but if you like to pay
      double I shall have no objection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, that arrangement will suit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In evidence of my satisfaction I gave him a bottle of Scopolo, which Leah
      guaranteed pure.
    </p>
    <p>
      We dined together, and seeing that the wine was making her mirthful I told
      her that her eyes were inflaming me and that she must let me kiss them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My duty obliges me to say nay. No kissing and no touching; we have only
      got to eat and drink together, and I shall like it as much as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am wholly dependent on my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I ask your father to give you leave to be kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that would be proper, and my father might be offended and
      not allow me to see you any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And supposing he told you not to be scrupulous about trifles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I should despise him and continue to do my duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So clear a declaration shewed me that if I persevered in this intrigue I
      might go on for ever without success. I also bethought me that I ran a
      risk of neglecting my chief business, which would not allow me to stay
      long in Ancona.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said nothing more to Leah just then, and when the dessert came in I gave
      her some Cyprus wine, which she declared was the most delicious nectar she
      had ever tasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that the wine was heating her, and it seemed incredible to me that
      Bacchus should reign without Venus; but she had a hard head, her blood was
      hot and her brain cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I tried to seize her hand and kiss it, but she drew it away,
      saying pleasantly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too much for honour and too little for love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This witty remark amused me, and it also let me know that she was not
      exactly a neophyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      I determined to postpone matters till the next day, and told her not to
      get me any supper as I was supping with the Venetian consul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consul had told me that he did not dine, but that he would always be
      delighted to see me at supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was midnight when I came home, and everyone was asleep except the maid
      who let me in. I gave her such a gratuity that she must have wished me to
      keep late hours for the rest of my stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      I proceeded to sound her about Leah, but she told me nothing but good. If
      she was to be believed, Leah was a good girl, always at work, loved by
      all, and fancy free. The maid could not have praised her better if she had
      been paid to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning Leah brought the chocolate and sat down on my bed, saying
      that we should have some fine foie gras, and that she should have all the
      better appetite for dinner as she had not taken any supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you take any supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it was because of your excellent Cyprus wine, to which my
      father has taken a great liking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! he like it? We will give him some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leah was in a state of undress as before, and the sight of her
      half-covered spheres drove me to distraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not aware that you have a beautiful breast?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought all young girls were just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no suspicion that the sight is a very pleasant one for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that be so, I am very glad, for I have nothing to be ashamed of, for a
      girl has no call to hide her throat any more than her face, unless she is
      in grand company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she was speaking, Leah looked at a golden heart transfixed with an
      arrow and set with small diamonds which served me as a shirt stud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like the little heart?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much. Is it pure gold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, and that being so I think I may offer it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying I took it off, but she thanked me politely, and said that a girl
      who gave nothing must take nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it; I will never ask any favour of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I should be indebted to you, and that&rsquo;s the reason why I never take
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw that there was nothing to be done, or rather that it would be
      necessary to do too much to do anything, and that in any case the best
      plan would be to give her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      I put aside all thoughts of violence, which would only anger her or make
      her laugh at me. I should either have been degraded, or rendered more
      amorous, and all for nothing. If she had taken offense she would not have
      come to see me any more, and I should have had nought to complain of. In
      fine I made up my mind to restrain myself, and indulge no more in amorous
      talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      We dined very pleasantly together. The servant brought in some shell-fish,
      which are forbidden by the Mosaic Law. While the maid was in the room I
      asked Leah to take some, and she refused indignantly; but directly the
      girl was gone she took some of her own accord and ate them eagerly,
      assuring me that it was the first time she had had the pleasure of tasting
      shellfish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This girl,&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;who breaks the law of her religion with
      such levity, who likes pleasure and does not conceal it, this is the girl
      who wants to make me believe that she is insensible to the pleasures of
      love; that&rsquo;s impossible, though she may not love me. She must have some
      secret means of satisfying her passions, which in my opinion are very
      violent. We will see what can be done this evening with the help of a
      bottle of good Muscat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, when the evening came, she said she could not drink or eat
      anything, as a meal always prevented her sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day she brought me my chocolate, but her beautiful breast was
      covered with a white kerchief. She sat down on the bed as usual, and I
      observed in a melancholy manner that she had only covered her breast
      because I had said I took a pleasure in seeing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied that she had not thought of anything, and had only put on her
      kerchief because she had had no time to fasten her stays.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are whole right,&rdquo; I said, smilingly, &ldquo;for if I were to see the whole
      breast I might not think it beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave no answer, and I finished my chocolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recollected my collection of obscene pictures, and I begged Leah to give
      me the box, telling her that I would shew her some of the most beautiful
      breasts in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t care to see them,&rdquo; said she; but she gave me the box, and sat
      down on my bed as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took out a picture of a naked woman lying on her back and abusing
      herself, and covering up the lower part of it I shewed it to Leah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But her breast is like any other,&rdquo; said Leah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take away your handkerchief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it back; it&rsquo;s disgusting. It&rsquo;s well enough done,&rdquo; she added, with a
      burst of laughter, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s no novelty for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No novelty for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not; every girl does like that before she gets married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do it, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever I want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A well-bred girl always does it in private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you do after?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am in bed I go to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Leah, your sincerity is too much for me. Either be kind or visit
      me no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very weak, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, because I am strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then henceforth we shall only meet at dinner. But shew me some more
      miniatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some pictures which you will not like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave her Arentin&rsquo;s figures, and was astonished to see how coolly she
      examined them, passing from one to the other in the most commonplace way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think them interesting?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very; they are so natural. But a good girl should not look at such
      pictures; anyone must be aware that these voluptuous attitudes excite
      one&rsquo;s emotions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you, Leah, and I feel it as much as you. Look here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and took the book away to the window, turning her back towards
      me without taking any notice of my appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to cool down and dress myself, and when the hairdresser arrived Leah
      went away, saying she would return me my book at dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was delighted, thinking I was sure of victory either that day or the
      next, but I was out of my reckoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      We dined well and drank better. At dessert Leah took the book out of her
      pocket and set me all on fire by asking me to explain some of the pictures
      but forbidding all practical demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went out impatiently, determined to wait till next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the cruel Jewess came in the morning she told me that she wanted
      explanations, but that I must use the pictures and nothing more as a
      demonstration of my remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but you must answer all my questions as to your
      sex.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise to do so, if they arise naturally from the pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lesson lasted two hours, and a hundred times did I curse Aretin and my
      folly in shewing her his designs, for whenever I made the slightest
      attempt the pitiless woman threatened to leave me. But the information she
      gave me about her own sex was a perfect torment to me. She told me the
      most lascivious details, and explained with the utmost minuteness the
      different external and internal movements which would be developed in the
      copulations pictured by Aretin. I thought it quite impossible that she
      could be reasoning from theory alone. She was not troubled by the
      slightest tincture of modesty, but philosophized on coition as coolly and
      much more learnedly than Hedvig. I would willingly have given her all I
      possessed to crown her science by the performance of the great work. She
      swore it was all pure theory with her, and I thought she must be speaking
      the truth when she said she wanted to get married to see if her notions
      were right or wrong. She looked pensive when I told her that the husband
      destined for her might be unable to discharge his connubial duties more
      than once a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that one man is not as good as another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are not all men able to make love every day, and every hour, just as they
      eat, drink and sleep every day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear Leah, they that can make love every day are very scarce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In my state of chronic irritation I felt much annoyed that there was no
      decent place at Ancona where a man might appease his passions for his
      money. I trembled to think that I was in danger of falling really in love
      with Leah, and I told the consul every day that I was in no hurry to go. I
      was as foolish as a boy in his calf-love. I pictured Leah as the purest of
      women, for with strong passions she refused to gratify them. I saw in her
      a model of virtue; she was all self-restraint and purity, resisting
      temptation in spite of the fire that consumed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long the reader will discover how very virtuous Leah was.
    </p>
    <p>
      After nine or ten days I had recourse to violence, not in deeds but in
      words. She confessed I was in the right, and said my best plan would be to
      forbid her to come and see me in the morning. At dinner, according to her,
      there would be no risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made up my mind to ask her to continue her visits, but to cover her
      breast and avoid all amorous conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; she replied, laughing; &ldquo;but be sure I shall not be
      the first to break the conditions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt no inclination to break them either, for three days later I felt
      weary of the situation, and told the consul I would start on the first
      opportunity. My passion for Leah was spoiling my appetite, and I thus saw
      myself deprived of my secondary pleasure without any prospect of gaining
      my primary enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      After what I had said to the consul I felt I should be bound to go, and I
      went to bed calmly enough. But about two o&rsquo;clock in the morning I had,
      contrary to my usual habit, to get up and offer sacrifice to Cloacina. I
      left my room without any candle, as I knew my way well enough about the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The temple of the goddess was on the ground floor, but as I had put on my
      soft slippers, and walked very softly, my footsteps did not make the least
      noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my way upstairs I saw a light shining through a chink in the door of a
      room which I knew to be unoccupied. I crept softly up, not dreaming for a
      moment that Leah could be there at such an hour. But on putting my eye to
      the chink I found I could see a bed, and on it were Leah and a young man,
      both stark naked, and occupied in working out Aretin&rsquo;s postures to the
      best of their ability. They were whispering to one another, and every four
      or five minutes I had the pleasure of seeing a new posture. These changes
      of position gave me a view of all the beauties of Leah, and this pleasure
      was something to set against my rage in having taken such a profligate
      creature for a virtuous woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time they approached the completion of the great work they stopped
      short, and completed what they were doing with their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were doing the Straight Tree, to my mind the most lascivious of
      them all, Leah behaved like a true Lesbian; for while the young man
      excited her amorous fury she got hold of his instrument and took it
      between her lips till the work was complete. I could not doubt that she
      had swallowed the vital fluid of my fortunate rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Adonis then shewed her the feeble instrument, and Leah seemed to
      regret what she had done. Before long she began to excite him again; but
      the fellow looked at his watch, pushed her away, and began to put on his
      shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leah seemed angry, and I could see that she reproached him for some time
      before she began to dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were nearly clothed I softly returned to my room and looked out
      of a window commanding the house-door. I had not to wait long before I saw
      the fortunate lover going out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to bed indignant with Leah; I felt myself degraded. She was no
      longer virtuous, but a villainous prostitute in my eyes; and I fell to
      sleep with the firm resolve of driving her from my room the next morning,
      after shaming her with the story of the scene I had witnessed. But, alas,
      hasty and angry resolves can seldom withstand a few hours&rsquo; sleep. As soon
      as I saw Leah coming in with my chocolate, smiling and gay as usual, I
      told her quite coolly all the exploits I had seen her executing, laying
      particular stress on the Straight Tree, and the curious liquid she had
      swallowed. I ended by saying that I hoped she would give me the next
      night, both to crown my love and insure my secrecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered with perfect calm that I had nothing to expect from her as
      she did not love me, and as for keeping the secret she defied me to
      disclose it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you would not be guilty of such a disgraceful action,&rdquo; said
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words she turned her back on me and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not help confessing to myself that she was in the right; I could
      not bring myself to commit such a baseness. She had made me reasonable in
      a few words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t love you.&rdquo; There was no reply to this, and I felt I had no claim
      on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather it was she who might complain of me; what right had I to spy over
      her? I could not accuse her of deceiving me; she was free to do what she
      liked with herself. My best course was clearly to be silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dressed myself hastily, and went to the Exchange, where I heard that a
      vessel was sailing for Fiume the same day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiume is just opposite Ancona on the other side of the gulf. From Fiume to
      Trieste the distance is forty miles, and I decided to go by that route.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went aboard the ship and took the best place, said good-bye to the
      consul, paid Mardocheus, and packed my trunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leah heard that I was going the same day, and came and told me that she
      could not give me back my lace and my silk stockings that day, but that I
      could have them by the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father,&rdquo; I replied coolly, &ldquo;will hand them all over to the Venetian
      consul, who will send them to me at Trieste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just as I was sitting down to dinner, the captain of the boat came for my
      luggage with a sailor. I told him he could have my trunk, and that I would
      bring the rest aboard whenever he liked to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend setting out an hour before dusk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Mardocheus heard where I was going he begged me to take charge of a
      small box and a letter he wanted to send to a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted to do you this small service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At dinner Leah sat down with me and chattered as usual, without troubling
      herself about my monosyllabic answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I supposed she wished me to credit her with calm confidence and
      philosophy, while I looked upon it all as brazen impudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hated and despised her. She had inflamed my passions, told me to my face
      she did not love me, and seemed to claim my respect through it all.
      Possibly she expected me to be grateful for her remark that she believed
      me incapable of betraying her to her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she drank my Scopolo she said there were several bottles left, as well
      as some Muscat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make you a present of it all,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;it will prime you up for
      your nocturnal orgies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and said I had had a gratuitous sight of a spectacle which was
      worth money, and that if I were not going so suddenly she would gladly
      have given me another opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This piece of impudence made me want to break the wine bottle on her head.
      She must have known what I was going to do from the way I took it up, but
      she did not waver for a moment. This coolness of hers prevented my
      committing a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      I contented myself with saying that she was the most impudent slut I had
      ever met, and I poured the wine into my glass with a shaking hand, as if
      that were the purpose for which I had taken up the bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this scene I got up and went into the next room; nevertheless, in
      half an hour she came to take coffee with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      This persistence of hers disgusted me, but I calmed myself by the
      reflection that her conduct must be dictated by vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to help you to pack,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I should like to be left alone,&rdquo; I replied; and taking her by the arm
      I led her out of the room and locked the door after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were both of us in the right. Leah had deceived and humiliated me, and
      I had reason to detest her, while I had discovered her for a monster of
      hypocrisy and immodesty, and this was good cause for her to dislike me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards evening two sailors came after the rest of the luggage, and
      thanking my hostess I told Leah to put up my linen, and to give it to her
      father, who had taken the box of which I was to be the bearer down to the
      vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      We set sail with a fair wind, and I thought never to set face on Leah
      again. But fate had ordered otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had gone twenty miles with a good wind in our quarter, by which we were
      borne gently from wave to wave, when all of a sudden there fell a dead
      calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      These rapid changes are common enough in the Adriatic, especially in the
      part we were in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calm lasted but a short time, and a stiff wind from the
      west-north-west began to blow, with the result that the sea became very
      rough, and I was very ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight the storm had become dangerous. The captain told me that if we
      persisted in going in the wind&rsquo;s eye we should be wrecked, and that the
      only thing to be done was to return to Ancona.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than three hours we made the harbour, and the officer of the guard
      having recognized me kindly allowed me to land.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was talking to the officer the sailors took my trunks, and carried
      them to my old lodgings without waiting to ask my leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was vexed. I wanted to avoid Leah, and I had intended to sleep at the
      nearest inn. However, there was no help for it. When I arrived the Jew got
      up, and said he was delighted to see me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was past three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and I felt very ill, so I said I
      would not get up till late, and that I would dine in my bed without any
      foie gras. I slept ten hours, and when I awoke I felt hungry and rang my
      bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid answered and said that she would have the honour of waiting on
      me, as Leah had a violent headache.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made no answer, thanking Providence for delivering me from this impudent
      and dangerous woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having found my dinner rather spare I told the cook to get me a good
      supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was dreadful. The Venetian consul had heard of my return, and
      not having seen me concluded I was ill, and paid me a two hours&rsquo; visit. He
      assured me the storm would last for a week at least. I was very sorry to
      hear it; in the first place, because I did not want to see any more of
      Leah, and in the second, because I had not got any money. Luckily I had
      got valuable effects, so this second consideration did not trouble me
      much.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I did not see Leah at supper-time I imagined that she was feigning
      illness to avoid meeting me, and I felt very much obliged to her on this
      account. As it appeared, however, I was entirely mistaken in my
      conjectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day she came to ask for chocolate in her usual way, but she no
      longer bore upon her features her old tranquillity of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take coffee, mademoiselle,&rdquo; I observed; &ldquo;and as I do not want foie
      gras any longer, I will take dinner by myself. Consequently, you may tell
      your father that I shall only pay seven paoli a day. In future I shall
      only drink Orvieto wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have still four bottles of Scopolo and Cyprus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never take back a present; the wine belongs to you. I shall be obliged
      by your leaving me alone as much as possible, as your conduct is enough to
      irritate Socrates, and I am not Socrates. Besides, the very sight of you
      is disagreeable to me. Your body may be beautiful, but knowing that the
      soul within is a monster it charms me no longer. You may be very sure that
      the sailors brought my luggage here without my orders, or else you would
      never have seen me here again, where I dread being poisoned every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leah went out without giving me any answer, and I felt certain that after
      my plain-spoken discourse she would take care not to trouble me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experience had taught me that girls like Leah are not uncommon. I had
      known specimens at Spa, Genoa, London, and at Venice, but this Jewess was
      the worst I had ever met.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Saturday. When Mardocheus came back from the synagogue he asked me
      gaily why I had mortified his daughter, as she had declared she had done
      nothing to offend me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not mortified her, my dear Mardocheus, or at all events, such was
      not my intention; but as I have put myself on diet, I shall be eating no
      more foie gras, and consequently I shall dine by myself, and save three
      paoli a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leah is quite ready to pay me out of her private purse, and she wants to
      dine with you to assure you against being poisoned, as she informs me that
      you have expressed that fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was only a jest; I am perfectly aware that I am in the house of an
      honest man. I don&rsquo;t want your daughter to pay for herself, and to prove
      that I am not actuated by feelings of economy, you shall dine with me too.
      To offer to pay for me is an impertinence on her part. In fine, I will
      either dine by myself and pay you seven pawls a day, or I will pay you
      thirteen, and have both father and daughter to dine with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The worthy Mardocheus went away, saying that he really could not allow me
      to dine by myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner-time I talked only to Mardocheus, without glancing at Leah or
      paying any attention to the witty sallies she uttered to attract me. I
      only drank Orvieto.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dessert Leah filled my glass with Scopolo, saying that if I did not
      drink it neither would she.
    </p>
    <p>
      I replied, without looking at her, that I advised her only to drink water
      for the future, and that I wanted nothing at her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mardocheus, who liked wine, laughed and said I was right, and drank for
      three.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather continued bad, and I spent the rest of the day in writing, and
      after supper I retired and went to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly I was aroused by a slight noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard Leah&rsquo;s voice, whispering in reply,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis I; I have not come to disturb you, but to justify myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying she lay down on the bed, but on the outside of the coverlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was pleased with this extraordinary visit, for my sole desire was for
      vengeance, and I felt certain of being able to resist all her arts. I
      therefore told her politely enough that I considered her as already
      justified and that I should be obliged by her leaving me as I wanted to go
      to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not before you have heard what I have to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on; I am listening to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon she began a discourse which I did not interrupt, and which
      lasted for a good hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke very artfully, and after confessing she had done wrong she said
      that at my age I should have been ready to overlook the follies of a young
      and passionate girl. According to her it was all weakness, and pardonable
      at such an age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear I love you,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I would have given you good proof
      before now if I had not been so unfortunate as to love the young Christian
      you saw with me, while he does not care for me in the least; indeed I have
      to pay him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of my passion,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I have never given him what a
      girl can give but once. I had not seen him for six months, and it was your
      fault that I sent for him, for you inflamed me with your pictures and
      strong wines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The end of it all was that I ought to forget everything, and treat her
      kindly during the few days I was to remain there.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she finished I did not allow myself to make any objection. I
      pretended to be convinced, assuring her that I felt I had been in the
      wrong in letting her see Aretin&rsquo;s figures, and that I would no longer
      evince any resentment towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As her explanation did not seem likely to end in the way she wished, she
      went on talking about the weakness of the flesh, the strength of self-love
      which often hushes the voice of passion, etc., etc.; her aim being to
      persuade me that she loved me, and that her refusals had all been given
      with the idea of making my love the stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt I might have given her a great many answers, but I said nothing.
      I made up my mind to await the assault that I saw was impending, and then
      by refusing all her advances I reckoned on abasing her to the uttermost.
      Nevertheless, she made no motion; her hands were at rest, and she kept her
      face at a due distance from mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, tired out with the struggle, she left me pretending to be
      perfectly satisfied with what she had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she had gone, I congratulated myself on the fact that she had
      confined herself to verbal persuasion; for if she had gone further she
      would probably have achieved a complete victory, though we were in the
      dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must mention that before she left me I had to promise to allow her to
      make my chocolate as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the next morning she came for the stick of chocolate. She was in a
      complete state of negligee, and came in on tiptoe, though if she chose to
      look towards the bed she might have seen that I was wide awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      I marked her artifices and her cunning, and resolved to be equal to all
      her wiles. When she brought the chocolate I noticed that there were two
      cups on the tray, and I said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is not true that you don&rsquo;t like chocolate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel obliged to relieve you of all fear of being poisoned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I noticed that she was now dressed with the utmost decency, while half an
      hour before she had only her chemise and petticoat her neck being
      perfectly bare. The more resolved she seemed to gain the victory, the more
      firmly I was determined to humiliate her, as it appeared to me the only
      other alternative would have been my shame and dishonour; and this turned
      me to stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of my resolves, Leah renewed the attack at dinner, for, contrary
      to my orders, she served a magnificent foie gras, telling me that it was
      for herself, and that if she were poisoned she would die of pleasure;
      Mardocheus said he should like to die too, and began regaling himself on
      it with evident relish.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not help laughing, and announced my wish to taste the deadly food,
      and so we all of us were eating it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your resolves are not strong enough to withstand seduction,&rdquo; said Leah.
      This remark piqued me, and I answered that she was imprudent to disclose
      her designs in such a manner, and that she would find my resolves strong
      enough when the time came.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint smile played about her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try if you like,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to persuade me to drink some Scopolo or
      Muscat. I meant to have taken some, but your taunt has turned me to steel.
      I mean to prove that when I make up my mind I never alter it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The strong-minded man never gives way,&rdquo; said Leah, &ldquo;but the good-hearted
      man often lets himself be overpersuaded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, and the good-hearted girl refrains from taunting a man for his
      weakness for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I called the maid and told her to go to the Venetian consul&rsquo;s and get me
      some more Scopolo and Muscat. Leah piqued me once more by saying
      enthusiastically,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you are the most good-hearted of men as well as the firmest.&rdquo;
       Mardocheus, who could not make out what we meant, ate, drank, and laughed,
      and seemed pleased with everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon I went out to a cafe in spite of the dreadful weather. I
      thought over Leah and her designs, feeling certain that she would pay me
      another nocturnal visit and renew the assault in force. I resolved to
      weaken myself with some common woman, if I could find one at all
      supportable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Greek who had taken me to a disgusting place a few days before,
      conducted me to another where he introduced me to a painted horror of a
      woman from whose very sight I fled in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt angry that in a town like Ancona a man of some delicacy could not
      get his money&rsquo;s worth for his money, and went home, supped by myself, and
      locked the door after me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The precaution, however, was useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes after I had shut the door, Leah knocked on the pretext that
      I had forgotten to give her the chocolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I opened the door and gave it her, and she begged me not to lock myself
      in, as she wanted to have an important and final interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can tell me now what you want to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it will take some time, and I should not like to come till everyone
      is asleep. You have nothing to be afraid of; you are lord of yourself. You
      can go to bed in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have certainly nothing to be afraid of, and to prove it to you I will
      leave the door open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt more than ever certain of victory, and resolved not to blow out the
      candles, as my doing so might be interpreted into a confession of fear.
      Besides, the light would render my triumph and her humiliation more
      complete. With these thoughts I went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven o&rsquo;clock a slight noise told me that my hour had come. I saw Leah
      enter my room in her chemise and a light petticoat. She locked my door
      softly, and when I cried, &ldquo;Well; what do you want with me?&rdquo; she let her
      chemise and petticoat drop, and lay down beside me in a state of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was too much astonished to repulse her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leah was sure of victory, and without a word she threw herself upon me,
      pressing her lips to mine, and depriving me of all my faculties except
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I utilised a short moment of reflection by concluding that I was a
      presumptuous fool, and that Leah was a woman with a most extensive
      knowledge of human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a second my caress became as ardent as hers, and after kissing her
      spheres of rose and alabaster I penetrated to the sanctuary of love,
      which, much to my astonishment, I found to be a virgin citadel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence, and then I said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Leah, you oblige me to adore you; why did you first inspire me
      with hate? Are you not come here merely to humiliate me, to obtain an
      empty victory? If so, I forgive you; but you are in the wrong, for,
      believe me, enjoyment is sweeter far than vengeance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I have not come to achieve a shameful victory, but to give myself to
      you without reserve, to render you my conqueror and my king. Prove your
      love by making me happy, break down the barrier which I kept intact,
      despite its fragility and my ardour, and if this sacrifice does not
      convince you of my affection you must be the worst of men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had never heard more energetic opinions, and I had never seen a more
      voluptuous sight. I began the work, and while Leah aided me to the best of
      her ability, I forced the gate, and on Leah&rsquo;s face I read the most acute
      pain and pleasure mingled. In the first ecstasy of delight I felt her
      tremble in every limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for me, my enjoyment was quite new; I was twenty again, but I had the
      self-restraint of my age, and treated Leah with delicacy, holding her in
      my arms till three o&rsquo;clock in the morning. When I left her she was
      inundated and exhausted with pleasure, while I could do no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left me full of gratitude, carrying the soaking linen away with her. I
      slept on till twelve o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I awoke and saw her standing by my bedside with the gentle love of
      the day after the wedding, the idea of my approaching departure saddened
      me. I told her so, and she begged me to stay on as long as I could. I
      repeated that we would arrange everything when we met again at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had a delicious dinner, for Mardocheus was bent on convincing me that
      he was no miser.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent the afternoon with the consul, and arranged that I should go on a
      Neapolitan man-of-war which was in quarantine at the time, and was to sail
      for Trieste.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I should be obliged to pass another month at Ancona, I blessed the
      storm that had driven me back.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave the consul the gold snuff-box with which the Elector of Cologne had
      presented me, keeping the portrait as a memento. Three days later he
      handed me forty gold sequins, which was ample for my needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      My stay in Ancona was costing me dear; but when I told Mardocheus that I
      should not be going for another month he declared he would no longer feed
      at my expense. Of course I did not insist. Leah still dined with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has always been my opinion, though perhaps I may be mistaken, that the
      Jew was perfectly well aware of my relations with his daughter. Jews are
      usually very liberal on this article, possibly because they count on the
      child being an Israelite.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took care that my dear Leah should have no reason to repent of our
      connection. How grateful and affectionate she was when I told her that I
      meant to stay another month! How she blessed the bad weather which had
      driven me back. We slept together every night, not excepting those nights
      forbidden by the laws of Moses.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave her the little gold heart, which might be worth ten sequins, but
      that would be no reward for the care she had taken of my linen. She also
      made me accept some splendid Indian handkerchiefs. Six years later I met
      her again at Pesaro.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left Ancona on November 14th, and on the 15th I was at Trieste.

      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Pittoni&mdash;Zaguri&mdash;The Procurator Morosini&mdash;The Venetian
     Consul&mdash;Gorice&mdash;The French Consul&mdash;Madame Leo&mdash;My Devotion
     to The State Inquisitors&mdash;Strasoldo&mdash;Madame Cragnoline&mdash;
     General Burghausen
</pre>
    <p>
      The landlord asked me my name, we made our agreement, and I found myself
      very comfortably lodged. Next day I went to the post-office and found
      several letters which had been awaiting me for the last month. I opened
      one from M. Dandolo, and found an open enclosure from the patrician Marco
      Dona, addressed to Baron Pittoni, Chief of Police. On reading it, I found
      I was very warmly commended to the baron. I hastened to call on him, and
      gave him the letter, which he took but did not read. He told me that M.
      Dona had written to him about me, and that he would be delighted to do
      anything in his power for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then took Mardocheus&rsquo;s letter to his friend Moses Levi. I had not the
      slightest idea that the letter had any reference to myself, so I gave it
      to the first clerk that I saw in the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Levi was an honest and an agreeable man, and the next day he called on me
      and offered me his services in the most cordial manner. He shewed me the
      letter I had delivered, and I was delighted to find that it referred to
      myself. The worthy Mardocheus begged him to give me a hundred sequins in
      case I needed any money, adding that any politeness shewn to me would be
      as if shewn to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This behaviour on the part of Mardocheus filled me with gratitude, and
      reconciled me, so to speak, with the whole Jewish nation. I wrote him a
      letter of thanks, offering to serve him at Venice in any way I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not help comparing the cordiality of Levi&rsquo;s welcome with the
      formal and ceremonious reception of Baron Pittoni. The baron was ten or
      twelve years younger than I. He was a man of parts, and quite devoid of
      prejudice. A sworn foe of &lsquo;meum and tuum&rsquo;, and wholly incapable of
      economy, he left the whole care of his house to his valet, who robbed him,
      but the baron knew it and made no objection. He was a determined bachelor,
      a gallant, and the friend and patron of libertines. His chief defect was
      his forgetfulness and absence of mind, which made him mismanage important
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was reputed, though wrongly, to be a liar. A liar is a person who tells
      falsehoods intentionally, while if Pittoni told lies it was because he had
      forgotten the truth. We became good friends in the course of a month, and
      we have remained friends to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote to my friends at Venice, announcing my arrival at Trieste, and for
      the next ten days I kept my room, busied in putting together the notes I
      had made on Polish events since the death of Elizabeth Petrovna. I meant
      to write a history of the troubles of unhappy Poland up to its
      dismemberment, which was taking place at the epoch in which I was writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had foreseen all this when the Polish Diet recognized the dying czarina
      as Empress of all the Russians, and the Elector of Brandenburg as King of
      Prussia, and I proceeded with my history; but only the first three volumes
      were published, owing to the printers breaking the agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four last volumes will be found in manuscript after my death, and
      anyone who likes may publish them. But I have become indifferent to all
      this as to many other matters since I have seen Folly crowned king of the
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day there is no such country as Poland, but it might still be in
      existence if it had not been for the ambition of the Czartoryski family,
      whose pride had been humiliated by Count Bruhl, the prime minister. To
      gain vengeance Prince Augustus Czartoryski ruined his country. He was so
      blinded by passion that he forgot that all actions have their inevitable
      results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Czartoryski had determined not only to exclude the House of Saxony from
      the succession, but to dethrone the member of that family who was
      reigning. To do this the help of the Czarina and of the Elector of
      Brandenburg was necessary, so he made the Polish Diet acknowledge the one
      as Empress of all the Russians, and the other as King of Prussia. The two
      sovereigns would not treat with the Polish Commonwealth till this claim
      had been satisfied; but the Commonwealth should never have granted these
      titles, for Poland itself possessed most of the Russias, and was the true
      sovereign of Prussia, the Elector of Brandenburg being only Duke of
      Prussia in reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Czartoryski, blinded by the desire of vengeance, persuaded the Diet
      that to give the two sovereigns these titles would be merely a form, and
      that they would never become anything more than honorary. This might be
      so, but if Poland had possessed far-seeing statesmen they would have
      guessed that an honorary title would end in the usurpation of the whole
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russian palatin had the pleasure of seeing his nephew Stanislas
      Poniatowski on the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      I myself told him that these titles gave a right, and that the promise not
      to make any use of them was a mere delusion. I added jokingly&mdash;for I
      was obliged to adopt a humorous tone&mdash;that before long Europe would
      take pity on Poland, which had to bear the heavy weight of all the Russias
      and the kingdom of Prussia as well, and the Commonwealth would find itself
      relieved of all these charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      My prophecy has been fulfilled. The two princes whose titles were allowed
      have torn Poland limb from limb; it is now absorbed in Russia and Prussia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second great mistake made by Poland was in not remembering the
      apologue of the man and the horse when the question of protection
      presented itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Republic of Rome became mistress of the world by protecting other
      nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Poland came to ruin through ambition, vengeance, and folly&mdash;but
      folly most of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same reason lay at the root of the French Revolution. Louis XVI. paid
      the penalty of his folly with his life. If he had been a wise ruler he
      would still be on the throne, and France would have escaped the fury of
      the Revolutionists. France is sick; in any other country this sickness
      might be remedied, but I would not wonder if it proved incurable in
      France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain emotional persons are moved to pity by the emigrant French nobles,
      but for my part I think them only worthy of contempt. Instead of parading
      their pride and their disgrace before the eyes of foreign nations, they
      should have rallied round their king, and either have saved the throne or
      died under its ruins. What will become of France? It was hard to say; but
      it is certain that a body without a head cannot live very long, for reason
      is situate in the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      On December 1st Baron Pittoni begged me to call on him as some one had
      come from Venice on purpose to see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dressed myself hastily, and went to the baron&rsquo;s, where I saw a
      fine-looking man of thirty-five or forty, elegantly dressed. He looked at
      me with the liveliest interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart tells me,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;that your excellence&rsquo;s name is Zaguri?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so, my dear Casanova. As soon as my friend Dandolo told me of
      your arrival here, I determined to come and congratulate you on your
      approaching recall, which will take place either this year or the next, as
      I hope to see two friends of mine made Inquisitors. You may judge of my
      friendship for you when I tell you that I am an &lsquo;avogador&rsquo;, and that there
      is a law forbidding such to leave Venice. We will spend to-day and
      to-morrow together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I replied in a manner to convince him that I was sensible of the honour he
      had done me; and I heard Baron Pittoni begging me to excuse him for not
      having come to see me. He said he had forgotten all about it, and a
      handsome old man begged his excellence to ask me to dine with him, though
      he had not the pleasure of knowing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Zaguri. &ldquo;Casanova has been here for the last ten days, and
      does not know the Venetian consul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hastened to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my own fault,&rdquo; I observed, &ldquo;I did not like calling on this
      gentleman, for fear he might think me contraband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The consul answered wittily that I was not contraband but in quarantine,
      pending my return to my native land; and that in the meanwhile his house
      would always be open to me, as had been the house of the Venetian consul
      at Ancona.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner he let me know that he knew something about me, and I was
      not at all sorry for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marco Monti, such was the consul&rsquo;s name, was a man of parts and much
      experience; a pleasant companion and a great conversationalist, fond of
      telling amusing stories with a grave face&mdash;in fact, most excellent
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was something of a &lsquo;conteur&rsquo; myself, and we soon became friendly rivals
      in telling anecdotes. In spite of his thirty additional years I was a
      tolerable match for him, and when we were in a room there was no question
      of gaming to kill the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      We became fast friends, and I benefited a good deal by his offices during
      the two years I spent in Trieste, and I have always thought that he had a
      considerable share in obtaining my recall. That was my great object in
      those days; I was a victim to nostalgia, or home sickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the Swiss and the Sclavs it is really a fatal disease, which carries
      them off if they are not sent home immediately. Germans are subject to
      this weakness also; whilst the French suffer very little, and Italians not
      much more from the complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      No rule, however, lacks its exception, and I was one. I daresay I should
      have got over my nostalgia if I had treated it with contempt, and then I
      should not have wasted ten years of my life in the bosom of my cruel
      stepmother Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dined with M. Zaguri at the consul&rsquo;s, and I was invited to dine with the
      governor, Count Auersperg, the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visit from a Venetian &lsquo;avogador&rsquo; made me a person of great
      consideration. I was no longer looked upon as an exile, but as one who had
      successfully escaped from illegal confinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after I accompanied M. Zaguri to Gorice, where he stayed three
      days to enjoy the hospitality of the nobility. I was included in all their
      invitations, and I saw that a stranger could live very pleasantly at
      Gorice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I met there a certain Count Cobenzl, who may be alive now&mdash;a man of
      wisdom, generosity, and the vastest learning, and yet without any kind of
      pretention. He gave a State dinner to M. Zaguri, and I had the pleasure of
      meeting there three or four most charming ladies. I also met Count Torres,
      a Spaniard whose father was in in the Austrian service. He had married at
      sixty, and had five children all as ugly as himself. His daughter was a
      charming girl in spite of her plainness; she evidently got her character
      from the mother&rsquo;s side. The eldest son, who was ugly and squinted, was a
      kind of pleasant madman, but he was also a liar, a profligate, a boaster,
      and totally devoid of discretion. In spite of these defects he was much
      sought after in society as he told a good tale and made people laugh. If
      he had been a student, he would have been a distinguished scholar, as his
      memory was prodigious. He it was who vainly guaranteed the agreement I
      made with Valerio Valeri for printing my &ldquo;History of Poland.&rdquo; I also met
      at Gorice a Count Coronini, who was known in learned circles as the author
      of some Latin treatises on diplomacy. Nobody read his books, but everybody
      agreed that he was a very learned man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also met a young man named Morelli, who had written a history of the
      place and was on the point of publishing the first volume. He gave me his
      MS. begging me to make any corrections that struck me as desirable. I
      succeeded in pleasing him, as I gave him back his work without a single
      note or alteration of any kind, and thus he became my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      I became a great friend of Count Francis Charles Coronini, who was a man
      of talents. He had married a Belgian lady, but not being able to agree
      they had separated and he passed his time in trifling intrigues, hunting,
      and reading the papers, literary and political. He laughed at those sages
      who declared that there was not one really happy person in the world, and
      he supported his denial by the unanswerable dictum:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I myself am perfectly happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, as he died of a tumor in the head at the age of thirty-five, he
      probably acknowledged his mistake in the agonies of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no such thing as a perfectly happy or perfectly unhappy man in
      the world. One has more happiness in his life and another more
      unhappiness, and the same circumstance may produce widely different
      effects on individuals of different temperaments.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not a fact that virtue ensures happiness for the exercise of some
      virtues implies suffering, and suffering is incompatible with happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      My readers may be aware that I am not inclined to make mental pleasure
      pre-eminent and all sufficing. It may be a fine thing to have a clear
      conscience, but I cannot see that it would at all relieve the pangs of
      hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baron Pittoni and myself escorted Zaguri to the Venetian border, and we
      then returned to Trieste together.
    </p>
    <p>
      In three or four days Pittoni took me everywhere, including the club where
      none but persons of distinction were admitted. This club was held at the
      inn where I was staying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the ladies, the most noteworthy was the wife of the merchant,
      David Riguelin, who was a Swabian by birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pittoni was in love with her and continued so till her death. His suit
      lasted for twelve years, and like Petrarch, he still sighed, still hoped,
      but never succeeded. Her name was Zanetta, and besides her beauty she had
      the charm of being an exquisite singer and a polished hostess. Still more
      noteworthy, however, was the unvarying sweetness and equability of her
      disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not want to know her long before recognizing that she was absolutely
      impregnable. I told Pittoni so, but all in vain; he still fed on empty
      hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanetta had very poor health, though no one would have judged so from her
      appearance, but it was well known to be the case. She died at an early
      age.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after M. Zaguri&rsquo;s departure, I had a note from the consul
      informing me that the Procurator Morosini was stopping in my inn, and
      advising me to call on him if I knew him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was infinitely obliged for this advice, for M. Morosini was a personage
      of the greatest importance. He had known me from childhood, and the reader
      may remember that he had presented me to Marshal Richelieu, at
      Fontainebleau, in 1750.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dressed myself as if I had been about to speak to a monarch, and sent in
      a note to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not long to wait; he came out and welcomed me most graciously,
      telling me how delighted he was to see me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he heard the reason of my being at Trieste, and how I desired to
      return to my country, he assured me he would do all in his power to obtain
      me my wish. He thanked me for the care I had taken of his nephew at
      Florence, and kept me all the day while I told him my principal
      adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glad to hear that M. Zaguri was working for me, and said that they
      must concert the matter together. He commended me warmly to the consul, who
      was delighted to be able to inform the Tribunal of the consideration with
      which M. Morosini treated me.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the procurator had gone I began to enjoy life at Trieste, but in
      strict moderation and with due regard for economy, for I had only fifteen
      sequins a month. I abjured play altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day I dined with one of the circle of my friends, who were the
      Venetian consul, the French consul (an eccentric but worthy man who kept a
      good cook), Pittoni, who kept an excellent table, thanks to his man who
      knew what was to his own interests, and several others.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the pleasures of love I enjoyed them in moderation, taking care of
      my purse and of my health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of the carnival I went to a masked ball at the theatre,
      and in the course of the evening a harlequin came up and presented his
      columbine to me. They both began to play tricks on me. I was pleased with
      the columbine, and felt a strong desire to be acquainted with her. After
      some vain researches the French consul, M. de St. Sauveur, told me that
      the harlequin was a young lady of rank, and that the columbine was a
      handsome young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I will introduce you to the harlequin&rsquo;s family,
      and I am sure you will appreciate her charms when you see her as a girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they persisted in their jokes I was able, without wounding decency
      overmuch, to convince myself that the consul was right on the question of
      sex; and when the ball was over I said I should be obliged by his
      introducing me as he had promised. He promised to do so the day after Ash
      Wednesday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus I made the acquaintance of Madame Leo, who was still pretty and
      agreeable, though she had lived very freely in her younger days. There was
      her husband, a son, and six daughters, all handsome, but especially the
      harlequin with whom I was much taken. Naturally I fell in love with her,
      but as I was her senior by thirty years, and had begun my addresses in a
      tone of fatherly affection, a feeling of shame prevented my disclosing to
      her the real state of my heart. Four years later she told me herself that
      she had guessed my real feelings, and had been amused by my foolish
      restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young girl learns deeper lessons from nature than we men can acquire
      with all our experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Easter of 1773 Count Auersperg, the Governor of Trieste, was
      recalled to Vienna, and Count Wagensberg took his place. His eldest
      daughter, the Countess Lantieri, who was a great beauty, inspired me with
      a passion which would have made me unhappy if I had not succeeded in
      hiding it under a veil of the profoundest respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      I celebrated the accession of the new governor by some verses which I had
      printed, and in which, while lauding the father, I paid conspicuous homage
      to the charms of the daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      My tribute pleased them, and I became an intimate friend of the count&rsquo;s.
      He placed confidence in me with the idea of my using it to my own
      advantage, for though he did not say so openly I divined his intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Venetian consul had told me that he had been vainly endeavouring for
      the last four years to get the Government of Trieste to arrange for the
      weekly diligence from Trieste to Mestre to pass by Udine, the capital of
      the Venetian Friuli.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This alteration,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;would greatly benefit the commerce of the
      two states; but the Municipal Council of Trieste opposes it for a
      plausible but ridiculous reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These councillors, in the depth of their wisdom, said that if the Venetian
      Republic desired the alteration it would evidently be to their advantage,
      and consequently to the disadvantage of Trieste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consul assured me that if I could in any way obtain the concession it
      would weigh strongly in my favour with the State Inquisitors, and even in
      the event of my non-success he would represent my exertions in the most
      favourable light.
    </p>
    <p>
      I promised I would think the matter over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding myself high in the governor&rsquo;s favour, I took the opportunity of
      addressing myself to him on the subject. He had heard about the matter,
      and thought the objection of the Town Council absurd and even monstrous;
      but he professed his inability to do anything himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Councillor Rizzi,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the most obstinate of them all, and has
      led astray the rest with his sophisms. But do you send me in a memorandum
      shewing that the alteration will have a much better effect on the large
      commerce of Trieste than on the comparatively trifling trade of Udine. I
      shall send it into the Council without disclosing the authorship, but
      backing it with my authority, and challenging the opposition to refute
      your arguments. Finally, if they do not decide reasonably I shall proclaim
      before them all my intention to send the memoir to Vienna with my opinion
      on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt confident of success, and wrote out a memoir full of
      incontrovertible reasons in favour of the proposed change.
    </p>
    <p>
      My arguments gained the victory; the Council were persuaded, and Count
      Wagensberg handed me the decree, which I immediately laid before the
      Venetian consul. Following his advice, I wrote to the secretary of the
      Tribunal to the effect that I was happy to have given the Government a
      proof of my zeal, and an earnest of my desire to be useful to my country
      and to be worthy of being recalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of regard for me the count delayed the promulgation of the decree for
      a week, so that the people of Udine heard the news from Venice before it
      had reached Trieste, and everybody thought that the Venetian Government
      had achieved its ends by bribery. The secretary of the Tribunal did not
      answer my letter, but he wrote to the consul ordering him to give me a
      hundred ducats, and to inform me that this present was to encourage me to
      serve the Republic. He added that I might hope great things from the mercy
      of the Inquisitors if I succeeded in negotiating the Armenian difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consul gave me the requisite information, and my impression was that
      my efforts would be in vain; however, I resolved to make the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four Armenian monks had left the Convent of St. Lazarus at Venice, having
      found the abbot&rsquo;s tyranny unbearable. They had wealthy relations at
      Constantinople, and laughed the excommunication of their late tyrant to
      scorn. They sought asylum at Vienna, promising to make themselves useful
      to the State by establishing an Armenian press to furnish all the Armenian
      convents with books. They engaged to sink a capital of a million florins
      if they were allowed to settle in Austria, to found their press, and to
      buy or build a convent, where they proposed to live in community but
      without any abbot.
    </p>
    <p>
      As might be expected the Austrian Government did not hesitate to grant
      their request; it did more, it gave them special privileges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of this arrangement would be to deprive Venice of a lucrative
      trade, and to place it in the emperor&rsquo;s dominions. Consequently the
      Viennese Court sent them to Trieste with a strong recommendation to the
      governor, and they had been there for the past six months.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Venetian Government, of course, wished to entice them back to Venice.
      They had vainly induced their late abbot to make handsome offers to them,
      and they then proceeded by indirect means, endeavoring to stir up
      obstacles in their way, and to disgust them with Trieste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consul told me plainly that he had not touched the matter, thinking
      success to be out of the question; and he predicted that if I attempted it
      I should find myself in the dilemma of having to solve the insoluble. I
      felt the force of the consul&rsquo;s remark when I reflected that I could not
      rely on the governor&rsquo;s assistance, or even speak to him on the subject. I
      saw that I must not let him suspect my design, for besides his duty to his
      Government he was a devoted friend to the interests of Trieste, and for
      this reason a great patron of the monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of these obstacles my nostalgia made me make acquaintance with
      these monks under pretence of inspecting their Armenian types, which they
      were already casting. In a week or ten days I became quite intimate with
      them. One day I said that they were bound in honour to return to the
      obedience of their abbot, if only to annul his sentence of
      excommunication.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most obstinate of them told me that the abbot had behaved more like a
      despot than a father, and had thus absolved them from their obedience.
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;no rascally priest has any right to cut off good
      Christians from communion with the Saviour, and we are sure that our
      patriarch will give us absolution and send us some more monks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could make no objection to these arguments; however, I asked on another
      occasion on what conditions they would return to Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most sensible of them said that in the first place the abbot must
      withdraw the four hundred thousand ducats which he had entrusted to the
      Marquis Serpos at four per cent.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sum was the capital from which the income of the Convent of St.
      Lazarus was derived. The abbot had no right whatever to dispose of it,
      even with the consent of a majority among the monks. If the marquis became
      bankrupt the convent would be utterly destitute. The marquis was an
      Armenian diamond merchant, and a great friend of the abbot&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then asked the monks what were the other conditions, and they replied
      that these were some matters of discipline which might easily be settled;
      they would give me a written statement of their grievances as soon as I
      could assure them that the Marquis Serpos was no longer in possession of
      their funds.
    </p>
    <p>
      I embodied my negotiations in writing, and sent the document to the
      Inquisitors by the consul. In six weeks I received an answer to the effect
      that the abbot saw his way to arranging the money difficulty, but that he
      must see a statement of the reforms demanded before doing so. This decided
      me to have nothing to do with the affair, but a few words from Count
      Wagensberg made me throw it up without further delay. He gave me to
      understand that he knew of my attempts to reconcile the four monks with
      their abbot, and he told me that he had been sorry to hear the report, as
      my success would do harm to a country where I lived and where I was
      treated as a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      I immediately told him the whole story, assuring him that I would never
      have begun the negotiation if I had not been certain of failure, for I
      heard on undoubted authority that Serpos could not possibly restore the
      four hundred thousand ducats.
    </p>
    <p>
      This explanation thoroughly dissipated any cloud that might have arisen
      between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Armenians bought Councillor Rizzi&rsquo;s house for thirty thousand florins.
      Here they established themselves, and I visited them from time to time
      without saying anything more about Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Wagensberg gave me another proof of his friendship. Unhappily for me
      he died during the autumn of the same year, at the age of fifty.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning he summoned me, and I found him perusing a document he had
      just received from Vienna. He told me he was sorry I did not read German,
      but that he would tell me the contents of the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you will be able to serve your country without in
      any way injuring Austria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to confide in you a State secret (it being understood of
      course that my name is never to be mentioned) which ought to be greatly to
      your advantage, whether you succeed or fail; at all hazards your
      patriotism, your prompt action, and your cleverness in obtaining such
      information will be made manifest. Remember you must never divulge your
      sources of information; only tell your Government that you are perfectly
      sure of the authenticity of the statement you make.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must know,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that all the commodities we export to
      Lombardy pass through Venice where they have to pay duty. Such has long
      been the custom, and it may still be so if the Venetian Government will
      consent to reduce the duty of four per cent to two per cent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A plan has been brought before the notice of the Austrian Court, and it
      has been eagerly accepted. I have received certain orders on the matter,
      which I shall put into execution without giving any warning to the
      Venetian Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In future all goods for Lombardy will be embarked here and disembarked at
      Mezzola without troubling the Republic. Mezzola is in the territories of
      the Duke of Modena; a ship can cross the gulf in the night, and our goods
      will be placed in storehouses, which will be erected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this way we shall shorten the journey and decrease the freights, and
      the Modenese Government will be satisfied with a trifling sum, barely
      equivalent to a fourth of what we pay to Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of all this, I feel sure that if the Venetian Government wrote
      to the Austrian Council of Commerce expressing their willingness to take
      two per cent henceforth, the proposal would be accepted, for we Austrians
      dislike novelties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not lay the matter before the Town Council for four or five days,
      as there is no hurry for us; but you had better make haste, that you may
      be the first to inform your Government of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If everything goes as I should wish I hope to receive an order from
      Vienna suspending the decree just as I am about to make it public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next morning the governor was delighted to hear that everything had been
      finished before midnight. He assured me that the consul should not have
      official information before Saturday. In the meanwhile the consul&rsquo;s uneasy
      state of mind was quite a trouble to me, for I could not do anything to
      set his mind at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saturday came and Councillor Rizzi told me the news at the club. He seemed
      in high spirits over it, and said that the loss of Venice was the gain of
      Trieste. The consul came in just then, and said that the loss would be a
      mere trifle for Venice, while the first-shipwreck would cost more to
      Trieste than ten years&rsquo; duty. The consul seemed to enjoy the whole thing,
      but that was the part he had to play. In all small trading towns like
      Trieste, people make a great account of trifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to dine with the consul, who privately confessed his doubts and
      fears on the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him how the Venetians would parry the blow, and he replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will have a number of very learned consultations, and then they will
      do nothing at all, and the Austrians will send their goods wherever they
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Government is such a wise one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or rather has the reputation of wisdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think it lives on its reputation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; like all your mouldy institutions, they continue to be simply
      because they have been. Old Governments are like those ancient dykes which
      are rotten at the base, and only stay in position by their weight and
      bulk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The consul was in the right. He wrote to his chief the same day, and in
      the course of the next week he heard that their excellencies had received
      information of the matter some time ago by extraordinary channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the present his duties would be confined to sending in any additional
      information on the same subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; said the consul; &ldquo;now, what do you think of the wisdom of
      our sages?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Bedlam of Charenton were their best lodging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In three weeks the consul received orders to give me another grant of a
      hundred ducats, and to allow me ten sequins a month, to encourage me to
      deserve well of the State.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that time I felt sure I should be allowed to return in the course of
      the year, but I was mistaken, for I had to wait till the year following.
    </p>
    <p>
      This new present, and the monthly payment of ten sequins put me at my
      ease, for I had expensive tastes of which I could not cure myself. I felt
      pleased at the thought that I was now in the pay of the Tribunal which had
      punished me, and which I had defied. It seemed to me a triumph, and I
      determined to do all in my power for the Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I must relate an amusing incident, which delighted everyone in
      Trieste.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the beginning of summer. I had been eating sardines by the
      sea-shore, and when I came home at ten o&rsquo;clock at night I was astonished
      to be greeted by a girl whom I recognized as Count Strasoldo&rsquo;s maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count was a handsome young man, but poor like most of that name; he
      was fond of expensive pleasures, and was consequently heavily in debt. He
      had a small appointment which brought him in an income of six hundred
      florins, and he had not the slightest difficulty in spending a year&rsquo;s pay
      in three months. He had agreeable manners and a generous disposition, and
      I had supped with him in company with Baron Pittoni several times. He had
      a girl in his service who was exquisitely pretty, but none of the count&rsquo;s
      friends attempted her as he was very jealous. Like the rest, I had seen
      and admired her, I had congratulated the count on the possession of such a
      treasure in her presence, but I had never addressed a word to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strasoldo had just been summoned to Vienna by Count Auersperg who liked
      him, and had promised to do what he could for him. He had got an
      employment in Poland, his furniture had been sold, he had taken leave of
      everyone, and nobody doubted that he would take his pretty maid with him.
      I thought so too, for I had been to wish him a pleasant journey that
      morning, and my astonishment at finding the girl in my room may be
      imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want, my dear?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, sir, but I don&rsquo;t want to go with Strasoldo, and I thought you
      would protect me. Nobody will be able to guess where I am, and Strasoldo
      will be obliged to go by himself. You will not be so cruel as to drive me
      away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dearest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you I will go away to-morrow, for Strasoldo is going to leave
      at day-break.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lovely Leuzica (this was her name), no one would refuse you an asylum,
      I least of all. You are safe here, and nobody shall come in without your
      leave. I am only too happy that you came to me, but if it is true that the
      count is your lover you may be sure he will not go so easily. He will stay
      the whole of to-morrow at least, in the hope of finding you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt he will look for me everywhere but here. Will you promise not to
      make me go with him even if he guesses that I am with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear I will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will have to share my bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I shall not inconvenience you, I agree with all my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall see whether you inconvenience me or not. Undress, quick! But
      where are your things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that I have is in a small trunk behind the count&rsquo;s carriage, but I
      don&rsquo;t trouble myself about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor count must be raging at this very moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, for he will not come home till midnight. He is supping with Madame
      Bissolotti, who is in love with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Leuzica had undressed and got into bed. In a moment I was
      beside her, and after the severe regimen of the last eight months I spent
      a delicious night in her arms, for of late my pleasures had been few.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leuzica was a perfect beauty, and worthy to be a king&rsquo;s mistress; and if I
      had been rich I would have set up a household that I might retain her in
      my service.
    </p>
    <p>
      We did not awake till seven o&rsquo;clock. She got up, and on looking out of the
      window saw Strasoldo&rsquo;s carriage waiting at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      I confronted her by saying that as long as she liked to stay with me no
      one could force her away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was vexed that I had no closet in my room, as I could not hide her from
      the waiter who would bring us coffee. We accordingly dispensed with
      breakfast, but I had to find out some way of feeding her. I thought I had
      plenty of time before me, but I was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o&rsquo;clock I saw Strasoldo and his friend Pittoni coming into the inn.
      They spoke to the landlord, and seemed to be searching the whole place,
      passing from one room to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed, and told Leuzica that they were looking for her, and that our
      turn would doubtless come before long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember your promise,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone in which this remark was delivered comforted her, and she
      exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; well, let them come; they will get nothing by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I heard footsteps approaching, and went out, closing the door behind me,
      and begging them to excuse my not asking them in, as there was a
      contraband commodity in my room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only tell me that it is not my maid,&rdquo; said Strasoldo, in a pitiable
      voice. &ldquo;We are sure she is here, as the sentinel at the gate saw her come
      in at ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, the fair Leuzica is at this moment in my room. I have
      given her my word of honour that no violence shall be used, and you may be
      sure I shall keep my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall certainly not attempt any violence, but I am sure she would come
      of her own free will if I could speak to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will ask her if she wishes to see you. Wait a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leuzica had been listening to our conversation, and when I opened the door
      she told me that I could let them in.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Strasoldo appeared she asked him proudly if she was under any
      obligations to him, if she had stolen anything from him, and if she was
      not perfectly free to leave him when she liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor count replied mildly that on the contrary it was he who owed her
      a year&rsquo;s wages and had her box in his possession, but that she should not
      have left him without giving any reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only reason is that I don&rsquo;t want to go to Vienna,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I
      told you so a week ago. If you are an honest man you will leave me my
      trunk, and as to my wages you can send them to me at my aunt&rsquo;s at Laibach
      if you haven&rsquo;t got any money now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I pitied Strasoldo from the bottom of my heart; he prayed and entreated,
      and finally wept like a child. However, Pittoni roused my choler by saying
      that I ought to drive the slut out of my room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not the man to tell me what I ought and what I ought not to do,&rdquo;
       I replied, &ldquo;and after I have received her in my apartments you ought to
      moderate your expressions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that I stood on my dignity he laughed, and asked me if I had fallen
      in love with her in so short a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strasoldo here broke in by saying he was sure she had not slept with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you are mistaken,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;for there&rsquo;s only one bed, and
      I did not sleep on the floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They found prayers and reproaches alike useless and left us at noon.
      Leuzica was profuse in her expressions of gratitude to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no longer any mystery, so I boldly ordered dinner for two, and
      promised that she should remain with me till the count had left Trieste.
    </p>
    <p>
      At three o&rsquo;clock the Venetian consul came, saying that Count Strasoldo had
      begged him to use his good offices with me to persuade me to deliver up
      the fair Leuzica.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must speak to the girl herself,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;she came here and stays
      here of her own free will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the worthy man had heard the girl&rsquo;s story he went away, saying that
      we had the right on our side.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening a porter brought her trunk, and at this she seemed touched
      but not repentant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leuzica supped with me and again shared my couch. The count left Trieste
      at day-break.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I was sure that he was gone, I took a carriage and escorted the
      fair Leuzica two stages on her way to Laibach. We dined together, and I
      left her in the care of a friend of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody said I had acted properly, and even Pittoni confessed that in my
      place he would have done the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Strasoldo came to a bad end. He got into debt, committed peculation,
      and had to escape into Turkey and embrace Islam to avoid the penalty of
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time the Venetian general, Palmanova, accompanied by the
      procurator Erizzo, came to Trieste to visit the governor, Count
      Wagensberg. In the afternoon the count presented me to the patricians who
      seemed astonished to see me at Trieste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The procurator asked me if I amused myself as well as I had done at Paris
      sixteen years ago, and I told him that sixteen years more, and a hundred
      thousand francs less, forced me to live in a different fashion. While we
      were talking, the consul came in to announce that the felucca was ready.
      Madame de Lantieri as well as her father pressed me to join the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave a bow, which might mean either no or yes, and asked the consul what
      the party was. He told me that they were going to see a Venetian
      man-of-war at anchor in the harbor; his excellence there being the captain
      I immediately turned to the countess and smilingly professed my regret
      that I was unable to set foot on Venetian soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody exclaimed at me,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have nothing to fear. You are with honest people. Your suspicion is
      quite offensive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all very fine, ladies and gentlemen, and I will come with all my
      heart, if your excellences will assure me that my joining this little
      party will not be known to the State Inquisitors possibly by to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was enough. Everybody looked at me in silence, and no objections
      could be found to my argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain of the vessel, who did not know me, spoke a few whispered
      words to the others, and then they left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the consul told me that the captain had praised my prudence
      in declining to go on board, as if anyone had chanced to tell him my name
      and my case whilst I was on his ship, it would have been his duty to
      detain me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I told the governor of this remark he replied gravely that he should
      not have allowed the ship to leave the harbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw the procurator Erizzo the same evening, and he congratulated me on
      my discretion, telling me he would take care to let the Tribunal know how
      I respected its decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time I had the pleasure of seeing a beautiful Venetian, who
      visited Trieste with several of her admirers. She was of the noble family
      of Bon, and had married Count Romili de Bergamo, who left her free to do
      whatever she liked. She drew behind her triumphal chariot an old general,
      Count Bourghausen, a famous rake who had deserted Mars for the past ten
      years in order to devote his remaining days to the service of Venus. He
      was a delightful man, and we became friends. Ten years later he was of
      service to me, as my readers will find in the next volume, which may
      perhaps be the last.

    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Some Adventures at Trieste&mdash;I Am of Service to the Venetian
     Government&mdash;My Expedition to Gorice and My Return to
     Trieste&mdash;I Find Irene as an Actress and Expert Gamester
</pre>
    <p>
      Some of the ladies of Trieste thought they would like to act a French
      play, and I was made stage manager. I had not only to choose the pieces,
      but to distribute the parts, the latter being a duty of infinite
      irksomeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the actresses were new to the boards, and I had immense trouble in
      hearing them repeat their parts, which they seemed unable to learn by
      heart. It is a well-known fact that the revolution which is really wanted
      in Italy is in female education. The very best families with few
      exceptions are satisfied with shutting up their daughters in a convent for
      several years till the time comes for them to marry some man whom they
      never see till the eve or the day of their marriage. As a consequence we
      have the &lsquo;cicisbeo&rsquo;, and in Italy as in France the idea that our nobles
      are the sons of their nominal fathers is a purely conventional one.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do girls learn in convents, especially in Italian convents? A few
      mechanical acts of devotion and outward forms, very little real religion,
      a good deal of deceit, often profligate habits, a little reading and
      writing, many useless accomplishments, small music and less drawing, no
      history, no geography or mythology, hardly any mathematics, and nothing to
      make a girl a good wife and a good mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for foreign languages, they are unheard of; our own Italian is so soft
      that any other tongue is hard to acquire, and the &lsquo;dolce far niente&rsquo; habit
      is an obstacle to all assiduous study.
    </p>
    <p>
      I write down these truths in spite of my patriotism. I know that if any of
      my fellow-countrywomen come to read me they will be very angry; but I
      shall be beyond the reach of all anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return to our theatricals. As I could not make my actresses get their
      parts letter perfect, I became their prompter, and found out by experience
      all the ungratefulness of the position.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actors never acknowledged their debt to the prompter, and put down to
      his account all the mistakes they make.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Spanish doctor is almost as badly off; if his patient recovers, the cure
      is set down to the credit of one saint or another; but if he dies, the
      physician is blamed for his unskilful treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A handsome negress, who served the prettiest of my actresses to whom I
      shewed great attentions, said to me one day,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out how you can be so much in love with my mistress, who is
      as white as the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never loved a white man?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but only because I had no negro, to whom I should
      certainly have given the preference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the negress became mine, and I found out the falsity of the
      axiom, &lsquo;Sublata lucerna nullum discrimen inter feminas&rsquo;, for even in the
      darkness a man would know a black woman from a white one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel quite sure myself that the negroes are a distinct species from
      ourselves. There is one essential difference, leaving the colour out of
      account&mdash;namely, that an African woman can either conceive or not,
      and can conceive a boy or a girl. No doubt my readers will disbelieve this
      assertion, but their incredulity would cease if I instructed them in the
      mysterious science of the negresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Rosenberg, grand chamberlain of the emperor, came on a visit to
      Trieste in company with an Abbe Casti, whose acquaintance I wished to make
      on account of some extremely blasphemous poems he had written. However, I
      was disappointed; and instead of a man of parts, I found the abbe to be an
      impudent worthless fellow, whose only merit was a knack of versification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Rosenberg took the abbe with him, because he was useful in the
      capacities of a fool and a pimp&mdash;occupations well suited to his morals,
      though by no means agreeable to his ecclesiastical status. In those days
      syphilis had not completely destroyed his uvula.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard that this shameless profligate, this paltry poetaster, had been
      named poet to the emperor. What a dishonour to the memory of the great
      Metastasio, a man free from all vices, adorned with all virtues, and of
      the most singular ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Casti had neither a fine style, nor a knowledge of dramatic requirements,
      as appears from two or three comic operas composed by him, in which the
      reader will find nothing but foolish buffooneries badly put together. In
      one of these comic operas he makes use of slander against King Theodore
      and the Venetian Republic, which he turns into ridicule by means of
      pitiful lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another piece called The Cave of Trophonius, Casti made himself the
      laughing-stock of the literary world by making a display of useless
      learning which contributes nothing towards the plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the persons of quality who came to Gorice, I met a certain Count
      Torriano, who persuaded me to spend the autumn with him at a country house
      of his six miles from Gorice.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had listened to the voice of my good genius I should certainly never
      have gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count was under thirty, and was not married. He could not exactly be
      called ugly in spite of his hangdog countenance, in which I saw the
      outward signs of cruelty, disloyalty, treason, pride, brutal sensuality,
      hatred, and jealousy. The mixture of bad qualities was such an appalling
      one that I thought his physiognomy was at fault, and the goods better than
      the sign. He asked me to come and see him so graciously that I concluded
      that the man gave the lie to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked about him before accepting the invitation, and I heard nothing but
      good. People certainly said he was fond of the fair sex, and was a fierce
      avenger of any wrong done to him, but not thinking either of these
      characteristics unworthy of a gentleman I accepted his invitation. He told
      me that he would expect me to meet him at Gorice on the first day of
      September, and that the next day we would leave for his estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In consequence of Torriano&rsquo;s invitation I took leave of everybody,
      especially of Count Wagensberg, who had a serious attack of that malady
      which yields so easily to mercury when it is administered by a skilled
      hand, but which kills the unfortunate who falls amongst quacks. Such was
      the fate of the poor count; he died a month after I had left Trieste.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left Trieste in the morning, dined at Proseco, and reached Gorice in
      good time. I called at Count Louis Torriano&rsquo;s mansion, but was told he was
      out. However, they allowed me to deposit what little luggage I had when I
      informed them that the count had invited me. I then went to see Count
      Torres, and stayed with him till supper-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got back to the count&rsquo;s I was told he was in the country, and would
      not be back till the next day, and that in the meantime my trunks had been
      taken to the inn where a room and supper had been ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was extremely astonished, and went to the inn, where I was served with a
      bad supper in an uncomfortable room; however, I supposed that the count
      had been unable to accommodate me in his house, and I excused him though I
      wished he had forewarned me. I could not understand how a gentleman who
      has a house and invites a friend can be without a room wherein to lodge
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Count Torriano came to see me, thanked me for my punctuality,
      congratulated himself on the pleasure he expected to derive from my
      society, and told me he was very sorry we could not start for two days, as
      a suit was to be heard the next day between himself and a rascally old
      farmer who was trying to cheat him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I will go and hear the pleadings; it will be an
      amusement for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon after he took his leave, without asking me where I intended dining,
      or apologizing for not having accommodated me himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not make him out; I thought he might have taken offence at my
      descending at his doors without having given him any warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Casanova,&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;you may be all abroad.
      Knowledge of character is an unfathomable gulf. We thought we had studied
      it deeply, but there is still more to learn; we shall see. He may have
      said nothing out of delicacy. I should be sorry to be found wanting in
      politeness, though indeed I am puzzled to know what I have done amiss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I dined by myself, made calls in the afternoon, and supped with Count
      Torres. I told him that I promised myself the pleasure of hearing the
      eloquence of the bar of Gorice the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be there, too,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as I am curious to see what sort of a
      face Torriano will put on it, if the countryman wins. I know something
      about the case,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and Torriano is sure of victory, unless
      the documents attesting the farmer&rsquo;s indebtedness happen to be forgeries.
      On the other hand, the farmer ought to win unless it can be shewn that the
      receipts signed by Torriano are forgeries. The farmer has lost in the
      first court and in the second court, but he has paid the costs and
      appealed from both, though he is a poor man. If he loses to-morrow he will
      not only be a ruined man, but be sentenced to penal servitude, while if he
      wins, Torriano should be sent to the galleys, together with his counsel,
      who has deserved this fate many times before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew Count Torres passed for somewhat of a scandal-monger, so his remarks
      made little impression on me beyond whetting my curiosity. The next day I
      was one of the first to appear in the court, where I found the bench,
      plaintiff and defendant, and the barristers, already assembled. The
      farmer&rsquo;s counsel was an old man who looked honest, while the count&rsquo;s had
      all the impudence of a practised knave. The count sat beside him, smiling
      disdainfully, as if he was lowering himself to strive with a miserable
      peasant whom he had already twice vanquished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer sat by his wife, his son, and two daughters, and had that air
      of modest assurance which indicates resignation and a good conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered how such honest people could have lost in two courts; I was
      sure their cause must be a just one.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all poorly clad, and from their downcast eyes and their humble
      looks I guessed them to be the victims of oppression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each barrister could speak for two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer&rsquo;s advocate spoke for thirty minutes, which he occupied by
      putting in the various receipts bearing the count&rsquo;s signature up to the
      time when he had dismissed the farmer, because he would not prostitute his
      daughters to him. He then continued, speaking with calm precision, to
      point out the anachronisms and contradictions in the count&rsquo;s books (which
      made his client a debtor), and stated that his client was in a position to
      prosecute the two forgers who had been employed to compass the ruin of an
      honest family, whose only crime was poverty. He ended his speech by an
      appeal for costs in all the suits, and for compensation for loss of time
      and defamation of character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The harangue of the count&rsquo;s advocate would have lasted more than two hours
      if the court had not silenced him. He indulged in a torrent of abuse
      against the other barrister, the experts in hand-writing, and the peasant,
      whom he threatened with a speedy consignment to the galleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pleadings would have wearied me if I had been a blind man, but as it
      was I amused myself by a scrutiny of the various physiognomies before me.
      My host&rsquo;s face remained smiling and impudent through it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pleadings over, the court was cleared, and we awaited the sentence in
      the adjoining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peasant and his family sat in a corner apart, sad, sorry, and
      comfortless, with no friend to speak a consoling word, while the count was
      surrounded by a courtly throng, who assured him that with such a case he
      could not possibly lose; but that if the judges did deliver judgment
      against him he should pay the peasant, and force him to prove the alleged
      forgery.
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened in profound silence, sympathising with the countryman rather
      than my host, whom I believed to be a thorough-paced scoundrel, though I
      took care not to say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Torres, who was a deadly foe to all prudence and discretion, asked
      me my opinion of the case, and I whispered that I thought the count should
      lose, even if he were in the right, on account of the infamous apostrophes
      of his counsel, who deserved to have his ears cut off or to stand in the
      pillory for six months.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the client too,&rdquo; said Torres aloud; but nobody had heard what I had
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      After we had waited for an hour the clerk of the court came in with two
      papers, one of which he gave to the peasant&rsquo;s counsel and the other to
      Torriano&rsquo;s. Torriano read it to himself, burst into a loud laugh, and then
      read it aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court condemned the count to recognize the peasant as his creditor, to
      pay all costs, and to give him a year&rsquo;s wages as damages; the peasant&rsquo;s
      right to appeal ad minimum on account of any other complaints he might
      have being reserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advocate looked downcast, but Torriano consoled him by a fee of six
      sequins, and everybody went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remained with the defendant, and asked him if he meant to appeal to
      Vienna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall appeal in another sort,&rdquo; said he; but I did not ask him what he
      meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      We left Gorice the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      My landlord gave me the bill, and told me he had received instructions not
      to insist on my paying it if I made any difficulty, as in that case the
      count would pay himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This struck me as somewhat eccentric, but I only laughed. However, the
      specimens I had seen of his character made me imagine that I was going to
      spend six weeks with a dangerous original.
    </p>
    <p>
      In two hours we were at Spessa, and alighted at a large house, with
      nothing distinguished about it from an architectural point of view. We
      went up to the count&rsquo;s room, which was tolerably furnished, and after
      shewing me over the house he took me to my own room. It was on the ground
      floor, stuffy, dark, and ill furnished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is the room my poor old father used to love to sit
      in; like you, he was very fond of study. You may be sure of enjoying
      perfect liberty here, for you will see no one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We dined late, and consequently no supper was served. The eating and the
      wine were tolerable, and so was the company of a priest, who held the
      position of the count&rsquo;s steward; but I was disgusted at hearing the count,
      who ate ravenously, reproach me with eating too slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we rose from table he told me he had a lot to do, and that we should
      see each other the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to my room to put things in order, and to get out my papers. I was
      then working at the second volume of the Polish troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening I asked for a light as it was growing dark, and presently a
      servant came with one candle. I was indignant; they ought to have given me
      wax lights or a lamp at least. However, I made no complaint, merely asking
      one of the servants if I was to rely on the services of any amongst them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our master has given us no instructions on the subject, but of course we
      will wait on you whenever you call us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This would have been a troublesome task, as there was no bell, and I
      should have been obliged to wander all over the house, to search the
      courtyard, and perhaps the road, whenever I wanted a servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who will do my room?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she has a key of her own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no need for a key, as your door has no lock, but you can bolt
      yourself in at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could only laugh, whether from ill humour or amusement I really cannot
      say. However, I made no remark to the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began my task, but in half an hour I was so unfortunate as to put out
      the candle whilst snuffing it. I could not roam about the house in the
      dark searching for a light, as I did not know my way, so I went to bed in
      the dark more inclined to swear than to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately the bed was a good one, and as I had expected it to be
      uncomfortable I went to sleep in a more tranquil humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning nobody came to attend on me, so I got up, and after putting
      away my papers I went to say good morning to my host in dressing-gown and
      nightcap. I found him under the hand of one of his men who served him as a
      valet. I told him I had slept well, and had come to breakfast with him;
      but he said he never took breakfast, and asked me, politely enough, not to
      trouble to come and see him in the morning as he was always engaged with
      his tenants, who were a pack of thieves. He then added that as I took
      breakfast he would give orders to the cook to send me up coffee whenever I
      liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will also be kind enough to tell your man to give me a touch with his
      comb after he has done with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder you did not bring a servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had guessed that I should be troubling you, I should certainly have
      brought one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not trouble me but you, for you will be kept waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. Another thing I want is a lock to my door, for I have
      important papers for which I am responsible, and I cannot lock them up in
      my trunk whenever I leave my room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is safe in my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, but you see how absurd it would be for you to be answerable in
      case any of my papers were missing. I might be in the greatest distress,
      and yet I should never tell you of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He remained silent for some time, and then ordered his man to tell the
      priest to put a lock on my door and give me the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was thinking, I noticed a taper and a book on the table beside
      his bed. I went up to it, and asked politely if I might see what kind of
      reading had beguiled him to sleep. He replied as politely, requesting me
      not to touch it. I withdrew immediately, telling him with a smile that I
      felt sure that it was a book of prayers, but that I would never reveal his
      secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have guessed what it is,&rdquo; he said, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left him with a courteous bow, begging him to send me his man and a cup
      of coffee, chocolate, or broth, it mattered not which.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went back to my room meditating seriously on his strange behaviour, and
      especially on the wretched tallow candle which was given me, while he had
      a wax taper. My first idea was to leave the house immediately, for though
      I had only fifty ducats in my possession my spirit was as high as when I
      was a rich man; but on second thoughts I determined not to put myself in
      the wrong by affronting him in such a signal manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tallow candle was the most grievous wrong, so I resolved to ask the
      man whether he had not been told to give me wax lights. This was
      important, as it might be only a piece of knavery or stupidity on the part
      of the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man came in an hour with a cup of coffee, sugared according to his
      taste or that of the cook. This disgusted me, so I let it stay on the
      table, telling him, with a burst of laughter (if I had not laughed I must
      have thrown the coffee in his face), that that was not the way to serve
      breakfast. I then got ready to have my hair done.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him why he had brought me a wretched tallow candle instead of two
      wax lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; the worthy man replied, humbly, &ldquo;I could only give you what the
      priest gave me; I received a wax taper for my master and a candle for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was sorry to have vexed the poor fellow, and said no more, thinking the
      priest might have taken a fancy to economise for the count&rsquo;s profit or his
      own. I determined to question him on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I was dressed I went out to walk off my bad humour. I met the
      priest-steward, who had been to the locksmith. He told me that the man had
      no ready-made locks, but he was going to fit my door with a padlock, of
      which I should have the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provided I can lock my door,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I care not how it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I returned to the house to see the padlock fitted, and while the locksmith
      was hammering away I asked the priest why he had given a tallow candle
      instead of one or two wax tapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should never dare to give you tapers, sir, without express orders from
      the count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought such a thing would go without saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in other houses, but here nothing goes without saying. I have to buy
      the tapers and he pays me, and every time he has one it is noted down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you can give me a pound of wax lights if I pay you for them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, but I think I must tell the count, for you know . . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know all about it, but I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave him the price of a pound of wax lights, and went for a walk, as he
      told me dinner was at one. I was somewhat astonished on coming back to the
      house at half-past twelve to be told that the count had been half an hour
      at table.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not know what to make of all these acts of rudeness; however, I
      moderated my passion once more, and came in remarking that the abbe had
      told me dinner was at one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is usually,&rdquo; replied the count, &ldquo;but to-day I wanted to pay some calls
      and take you with me, so I decided on dining at noon. You will have plenty
      of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then gave orders for all the dishes that had been taken away to be
      brought back.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made no answer, and sat down to table, and feigning good humour ate what
      was on the table, refusing to touch those dishes which had been taken
      away. He vainly asked me to try the soup, the beef, the entrees; I told
      him that I always punished myself thus when I came in late for a
      nobleman&rsquo;s dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still dissembling my ill humour, I got into his carriage to accompany him
      on his round of visits. He took me to Baron del Mestre, who spent the
      whole of the year in the country with his family, keeping up a good
      establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count spent the whole of the day with the baron, putting off the other
      visits to a future time. In the evening we returned to Spessa. Soon after
      we arrived the priest returned the money I had given him for the candles,
      telling me that the count had forgotten to inform him that I was to be
      treated as himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took this acknowledgement for what it was worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper was served, and I ate with the appetite of four, while the count
      hardly ate at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant who escorted me to my room asked me at what time I should like
      breakfast. I told him, and he was punctual; and this time the coffee was
      brought in the coffee-pot and the sugar in the sugar basin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The valet did my hair, and the maid did my room, everything was changed,
      and I imagined that I had given the count a little lesson, and that I
      should have no more trouble with him. Here, however, I was mistaken, as
      the reader will discover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three or four days later the priest came to me one morning, to ask when I
      would like dinner, as I was to dine in my room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the count left yesterday for Gorice, telling me he did not know
      when he should come back. He ordered me to give you your meals in your
      room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. I will dine at one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one could be more in favour of liberty and independence than myself,
      but I could not help feeling that my rough host should have told me he was
      going to Gorice. He stayed a week, and I should have died of weariness if
      it had not been for my daily visits to the Baron del Mestre. Otherwise
      there was no company, the priest was an uneducated man, and there were no
      pretty country girls. I felt as if I could not bear another four weeks of
      such a doleful exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the count came back, I spoke to him plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to Spessa,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to keep you company and to amuse myself; but
      I see that I am in the way, so I hope you will take me back to Gorice and
      leave me there. You must know that I like society as much as you do, and I
      do not feel inclined to die of solitary weariness in your house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He assured me that it should not happen again, that he had gone to Gorice
      to meet an actress, who had come there purposely to see him, and that he
      had also profited by the opportunity to sign a contract of marriage with a
      Venetian lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      These excuses and the apparently polite tone in which they were uttered
      induced me to prolong my stay with the extraordinary count.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew the whole of his income from vineyards, which produced an
      excellent white wine and a revenue of a thousand sequins a year. However,
      as the count did his best to spend double that amount, he was rapidly
      ruining himself. He had a fixed impression that all the tenants robbed
      him, so whenever he found a bunch of grapes in a cottage he proceeded to
      beat the occupants unless they could prove that the grapes did not come
      from his vineyards. The peasants might kneel down and beg pardon, but they
      were thrashed all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been an unwilling witness of several of these arbitrary and cruel
      actions, when one day I had the pleasure of seeing the count soundly
      beaten by two peasants. He had struck the first blow himself, but when he
      found that he was getting the worst of it he prudently took to his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was much offended with me for remaining a mere spectator of the fray;
      but I told him very coolly that, being the aggressor, he was in the wrong,
      and in the second place I was not going to expose myself to be beaten to a
      jelly by two lusty peasants in another man&rsquo;s quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      These arguments did not satisfy him, and in his rage he dared to tell me
      that I was a scurvy coward not to know that it was my duty to defend a
      friend to the death.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of these offensive remarks I merely replied with a glance of
      contempt, which he doubtless understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long the whole village had heard what had happened, and the joy was
      universal, for the count had the singular privilege of being feared by all
      and loved by none. The two rebellious peasants had taken to their heels.
      But when it became known that his lordship had announced his resolution to
      carry pistols with him in all future visits, everybody was alarmed, and
      two spokesmen were sent to the count informing him that all his tenants
      would quit the estate in a week&rsquo;s time unless he gave them a promise to
      leave them in peace in their humble abodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rude eloquence of the two peasants struck me as sublime, but the count
      pronounced them to be impertinent and ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have as good a right to taste the vines which we have watered with the
      sweat of our brow,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;as your cook has to taste the dishes
      before they are served on your table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The threat of deserting just at the vintage season frightened the count,
      and he had to give in, and the embassy went its way in high glee at its
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next Sunday we went to the chapel to hear mass, and when we came in the
      priest was at the altar finishing the Credo. The count looked furious, and
      after mass he took me with him to the sacristy, and begun to abuse and
      beat the poor priest, in spite of the surplice which he was still wearing.
      It was really a shocking sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest spat in his face and cried help, that being the only revenge in
      his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several persons ran in, so we left the sacristy. I was scandalised, and I
      told the count that the priest would be certain to go to Udine, and that
      it might turn out a very awkward business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try to prevent his doing so,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;even by violence, but in the
      first place endeavour to pacify him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No doubt the count was afraid, for he called out to his servants and
      ordered them to fetch the priest, whether he could come or no. His order
      was executed, and the priest was led in, foaming with rage, cursing the
      count, calling him excommunicated wretch, whose very breath was poisonous;
      swearing that never another mass should be sung in the chapel that had
      been polluted with sacrilege, and finally promising that the archbishop
      should avenge him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count let him say on, and then forced him into a chair, and the
      unworthy ecclesiastic not only ate but got drunk. Thus peace was
      concluded, and the abbe forgot all his wrongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later two Capuchins came to visit him at noon. They did not go,
      and as he did not care to dismiss them, dinner was served without any
      place being laid for the friars. Thereupon the bolder of the two informed
      the count that he had had no dinner. Without replying, the count had him
      accommodated with a plateful of rice. The Capuchin refused it, saying that
      he was worthy to sit, not only at his table, but at a monarch&rsquo;s. The
      count, who happened to be in a good humour, replied that they called
      themselves &ldquo;unworthy brethren,&rdquo; and that they were consequently not worthy
      of any of this world&rsquo;s good things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Capuchin made but a poor answer, and as I thought the count to be in
      the right I proceeded to back him up, telling the friar he ought to be
      ashamed at having committed the sin of pride, so strictly condemned by the
      rules of his order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Capuchin answered me with a torrent of abuse, so the count ordered a
      pair of scissors to be brought, that the beards of the filthy rogues might
      be cut off. At this awful threat the two friars made their escape, and we
      laughed heartily over the incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      If all the count&rsquo;s eccentricities had been of this comparatively harmless
      and amusing nature, I should not have minded, but such was far from being
      the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of chyle his organs must have distilled some virulent poison; he
      was always at his worst in his after dinner hours. His appetite was
      furious; he ate more like a tiger than a man. One day we happened to be
      eating woodcock, and I could not help praising the dish in the style of
      the true gourmand. He immediately took up his bird, tore it limb from
      limb, and gravely bade me not to praise the dishes I liked as it irritated
      him. I felt an inclination to laugh and also an inclination to throw the
      bottle at his head, which I should probably have indulged in had I been
      twenty years younger. However, I did neither, feeling that I should either
      leave him or accommodate myself to his humours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three months later Madame Costa, the actress whom he had gone to see at
      Gorice, told me that she would never have believed in the possibility of
      such a creature existing if she had not known Count Torriano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though he is a vigorous lover,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;it is a matter of great
      difficulty with him to obtain the crisis; and the wretched woman in his
      arms is in imminent danger of being strangled to death if she cannot
      conceal her amorous ecstacy. He cannot bear to see another&rsquo;s pleasure. I
      pity his wife most heartily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I will now relate the incident which put an end to my relations with this
      venomous creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst the idleness and weariness of Spessa I happened to meet a very
      pretty and very agreeable young widow. I made her some small presents, and
      finally persuaded her to pass the night in my room. She came at midnight
      to avoid observation, and left at day-break by a small door which opened
      on to the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had amused ourselves in this pleasant manner for about a week, when one
      morning my sweetheart awoke me that I might close the door after her as
      usual. I had scarcely done so when I heard cries for help. I quickly
      opened it again, and I saw the scoundrelly Torriano holding the widow with
      one hand while he beat her furiously with a stick he held in the other. I
      rushed upon him, and we fell together, while the poor woman made her
      escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had only my dressing-gown on, and here I was at a disadvantage; for
      civilized man is a poor creature without his clothes. However, I held the
      stick with one hand, while I squeezed his throat with the other. On his
      side he clung to the stick with his right hand, and pulled my hair with
      the left. At last his tongue started out and he had to let go.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was on my feet again in an instant, and seizing the stick I aimed a
      sturdy blow at his head, which, luckily for him, he partially parried.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not strike again, so he got up, ran a little way, and began to pick
      up stones. However, I did not wait to be pelted, but shut myself in my
      room and lay down on the bed, only sorry that I had not choked the villain
      outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I had rested I looked to my pistols, dressed myself, and went
      out with the intention of looking for some kind of conveyance to take me
      back to Gorice. Without knowing it I took a road that led me to the
      cottage of the poor widow, whom I found looking calm though sad. She told
      me she had received most of the blows on her shoulders, and was not much
      hurt. What vexed her was that the affair would become public, as two
      peasants had seen the count beating her, and our subsequent combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave her two sequins, begging her to come and see me at Gorice, and to
      tell me where I could find a conveyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sister offered to shew me the way to a farm, where I could get what I
      wanted. On the way she told me that Torriano had been her sister&rsquo;s enemy
      before the death of her husband because she rejected all his proposals.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found a good conveyance at the farm, and the man promised to drive me in
      to Gorice by dinner-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave him half-a-crown as an earnest, and went away, telling him to come
      for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned to the count&rsquo;s and had scarcely finished getting ready when the
      conveyance drove up.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was about to put my luggage in it, when a servant came from the count
      asking me to give him a moment&rsquo;s conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote a note in French, saying that after what had passed we ought not
      to meet again under his roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later he came into my room, and shut the door, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you won&rsquo;t speak to me, I have come to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you leave my house in this fashion you will dishonour me, and I will
      not allow it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, but I should very much like to see how you are going to
      prevent me from leaving your house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not allow you to go by yourself; we must go together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; I understand you perfectly. Get your sword or your pistols,
      and we will start directly. There is room for two in the carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do. You must dine with me, and then we can go in my carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make a mistake. I should be a fool if I dined with you when our
      miserable dispute is all over the village; to-morrow it will have reached
      Gorice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t dine with me, I will dine with you, and people may say what
      they like. We will go after dinner, so send away that conveyance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had to give in to him. The wretched count stayed with me till noon,
      endeavouring to persuade me that he had a perfect right to beat a
      country-woman in the road, and that I was altogether in the wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed, and said I wondered how he derived his right to beat a free
      woman anywhere, and that his pretence that I being her lover had no right
      to protect her was a monstrous one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had just left my arms,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;was I not therefore her natural
      protector? Only a coward or a monster like yourself would have remained
      indifferent, though, indeed, I believe that even you would have done the
      same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes before we sat down to dinner he said that neither of us
      would profit by the adventure, as he meant the duel to be to the death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you as far as I am concerned,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;and as to
      the duel, you can fight or not fight, as you please; for my part I have
      had satisfaction. If we come to a duel I hope to leave you in the land of
      the living, though I shall do my best to lay you up for a considerable
      time, so that you may have leisure to reflect on your folly. On the other
      hand, if fortune favours you, you may act as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go into the wood by ourselves, and my coachman shall have orders
      to drive you wherever you like if you come out of the wood by yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good indeed; and which would you prefer&mdash;swords or pistols?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swords, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I promise to unload my pistols as soon as we get into the carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was astonished to find the usually brutal count become quite polite at
      the prospect of a duel. I felt perfectly confident myself, as I was sure
      of flooring him at the first stroke by a peculiar lunge. Then I could
      escape through Venetian territory where I was not known.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I had good reasons for supposing that the duel would end in smoke as
      so many other duels when one of the parties is a coward, and a coward I
      believed the count to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      We started after an excellent dinner; the count having no luggage, and
      mine being strapped behind the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took care to draw the charges of my pistols before the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had heard him tell the coachman to drive towards Gorice, but every
      moment I expected to hear him order the man to drive up this or that
      turning that we might settle our differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked no questions, feeling that the initiative lay with him; but we
      drove on till we were at the gates of Gorice, and I burst out laughing
      when I heard the count order the coachman to drive to the posting inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as we got there he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were in the right; we must remain friends. Promise me not to tell
      anyone of what has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave him the promise; we shook hands, and everything was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I took up my abode in one of the quietest streets to finish
      my second volume on the Polish troubles, but I still managed to enjoy
      myself during my stay at Gorice. At last I resolved on returning to
      Trieste, where I had more chances of serving and pleasing the State
      Inquisitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stayed at Gorice till the end of the year 1773, and passed an extremely
      pleasant six weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      My adventure at Spessa had become public property. At first everybody
      addressed me on the subject, but as I laughed and treated the whole thing
      as a joke it would soon be forgotten. Torriano took care to be most polite
      whenever we met; but I had stamped him as a dangerous character, and
      whenever he asked me to dinner or supper I had other engagements.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the carnival he married the young lady of whom he had spoken to me,
      and as long as he lived her life was misery. Fortunately he died a madman
      thirteen or fourteen years after.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst I was at Gorice Count Charles Coronini contributed greatly to my
      enjoyment. He died four years later, and a month before his death he sent
      me his will in ostosyllabic Italian verses&mdash;a specimen of philosophic
      mirth which I still preserve. It is full of jest and wit, though I believe
      if he had guessed the near approach of death he would not have been so
      cheerful, for the prospect of imminent destruction can only enliven the
      heart of a maniac.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my stay at Gorice a certain M. Richard Lorrain came there. He was a
      bachelor of forty, who had done good financial service under the Viennese
      Government, and had now retired with a comfortable pension. He was a fine
      man, and his agreeable manners and excellent education procured him
      admission into the best company in the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      I met him at the house of Count Torres, and soon after he was married to
      the young countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      In October the new Council of Ten and the new Inquisitors took office, and
      my protectors wrote to me that if they could not obtain my pardon in the
      course of the next twelve months they would be inclined to despair. The
      first of the Inquisitors was Sagredo, and intimate friend of the
      Procurator Morosini&rsquo;s; the second, Grimani, the friend of my good Dandolo;
      and M. Zaguri wrote to me that he would answer for the third, who,
      according to law, was one of the six councillors who assist the Council of
      Ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may not be generally known that the Council of Ten is really a council
      of seventeen, as the Doge has always a right to be present.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned to Trieste determined to do my best for the Tribunal, for I
      longed to return to Venice after nineteen years&rsquo; wanderings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was then forty-nine, and I expected no more of Fortune&rsquo;s gifts, for the
      deity despises those of ripe age. I thought, however, that I might live
      comfortably and independently at Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had talents and experience, I hoped to make use of them, and I thought
      the Inquisitors would feel bound to give me some sufficient employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was writing the history of the Polish troubles, the first volume was
      printed, the second was in preparation, and I thought of concluding the
      work in seven volumes. Afterwards I had a translation of the &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; in
      view, and other literary projects would no doubt present themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fine, I thought myself sure of living in Venice, where many persons who
      would be beggars elsewhere continue to live at their ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left Gorice on the last day of December, 1773, and on January 1st I took
      up my abode at Trieste.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not have received a warmer welcome. Baron Pittoni, the Venetian
      consul, all the town councillors, and the members of the club, seemed
      delighted to see me again. My carnival was a pleasant one, and in the
      beginning of Lent I published the second volume of my work on Poland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief object of interest to me at Trieste was an actress in a company
      that was playing there. She was no other than the daughter of the
      so-called Count Rinaldi, and my readers may remember her under the name of
      Irene. I had loved her at Milan, and neglected her at Genoa on account of
      her father&rsquo;s misdeeds, and at Avignon I had rescued her at Marcoline&rsquo;s
      request. Eleven years had passed by since I had heard of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was astonished to see her, and I think more sorry than glad, for she was
      still beautiful, and I might fall in love again; and being no longer in a
      position to give her assistance, the issue might be unfortunate for me.
      However, I called on her the next day, and was greeted with a shriek of
      delight. She told me she had seen me at the theatre, and felt sure I would
      come and see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She introduced me to her husband, who played parts like Scapin, and to her
      nine-year-old daughter, who had a talent for dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave me an abridged account of her life since we had met. In the year
      I had seen her at Avignon she had gone to Turin with her father. At Turin
      she fell in love with her present husband, and left her parents to join
      her lot to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since that,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have heard of my father&rsquo;s death, but I do not
      know what has become of my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After some further conversation she told me she was a faithful wife,
      though she did not push fidelity so far as to drive a rich lover to
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no lovers here,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;but I give little suppers to a few
      friends. I don&rsquo;t mind the expense, as I win some money at faro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was the banker, and she begged me to join the party now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come after the play to-night,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but you must not expect
      any high play of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I kept the appointment and supped with a number of silly young tradesmen,
      who were all in love with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper she held a bank, and I was greatly astonished when I saw her
      cheating with great dexterity. It made me want to laugh; however, I lost
      my florins with a good grace and left. However, I did not mean to let
      Irene think she was duping me, and I went to see her next morning at
      rehearsal, and complimented her on her dealing. She pretended not to
      understand what I meant, and on my explaining myself she had the impudence
      to tell me that I was mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my anger I turned my back on her saying, &ldquo;You will be sorry for this
      some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this she began to laugh, and said, &ldquo;Well, well, I confess! and if you
      tell me how much you lost you shall have it back, and if you like you
      shall be a partner in the game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, Irene, I will not be present at any more of your suppers.
      But I warn you to be cautious; games of chance are strictly forbidden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that, but all the young men have promised strict secrecy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and breakfast with me whenever you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few days later she came, bringing her daughter with her. The girl was
      pretty, and allowed me to caress her.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Baron Pittoni met them at my lodgings, and as he liked young girls
      as well as I he begged Irene to make her daughter include him in her list
      of favoured lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I advised her not to reject the offer, and the baron fell in love with
      her, which was a piece of luck for Irene, as she was accused of playing
      unlawful games, and would have been severely treated if the baron had not
      given her warning. When the police pounced on her, they found no gaming
      and no gamesters, and nothing could be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene left Trieste at the beginning of Lent with the company to which she
      belonged. Three years later I saw her again at Padua. Her daughter had
      become a charming girl, and our acquaintance was renewed in the tenderest
      manner.

      APPENDIX AND SUPPLEMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whether the author died before the work was complete, whether the
      concluding volumes were destroyed by himself or his literary executors, or
      whether the MS. fell into bad hands, seems a matter of uncertainty, and
      the materials available towards a continuation of the Memoirs are
      extremely fragmentary. We know, however, that Casanova at last succeeded
      in obtaining his pardon from the authorities of the Republic, and he
      returned to Venice, where he exercised the honourable office of secret
      agent of the State Inquisitors&mdash;in plain language, he became a spy.
      It seems that the Knight of the Golden Spur made a rather indifferent
      &ldquo;agent;&rdquo; not surely, as a French writer suggests, because the dirty work
      was too dirty for his fingers, but probably because he was getting old and
      stupid and out-of-date, and failed to keep in touch with new forms of
      turpitude. He left Venice again and paid a visit to Vienna, saw beloved
      Paris once more, and there met Count Wallenstein, or Waldstein. The
      conversation turned on magic and the occult sciences, in, which Casanova
      was an adept, as the reader of the Memoirs will remember, and the count
      took a fancy to the charlatan. In short Casanova became librarian at the
      count&rsquo;s Castle of Dux, near Teplitz, and there he spent the fourteen
      remaining years of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Prince de Ligne (from whose Memoirs we learn these particulars)
      remarks, Casanova&rsquo;s life had been a stormy and adventurous one, and it
      might have been expected that he would have found his patron&rsquo;s library a
      pleasant refuge after so many toils and travels. But the man carried rough
      weather and storm in his own heart, and found daily opportunities of
      mortification and resentment. The coffee was ill made, the maccaroni not
      cooked in the true Italian style, the dogs had bayed during the night, he
      had been made to dine at a small table, the parish priest had tried to
      convert him, the soup had been served too hot on purpose to annoy him, he
      had not been introduced to a distinguished guest, the count had lent a
      book without telling him, a groom had not taken off his hat; such were his
      complaints. The fact is Casanova felt his dependent position and his utter
      poverty, and was all the more determined to stand to his dignity as a man
      who had talked with all the crowned heads of Europe, and had fought a duel
      with the Polish general. And he had another reason for finding life bitter&mdash;he
      had lived beyond his time. Louis XV. was dead, and Louis XVI. had been
      guillotined; the Revolution had come; and Casanova, his dress, and his
      manners, appeared as odd and antique as some &ldquo;blood of the Regency&rdquo; would
      appear to us of these days. Sixty years before, Marcel, the famous
      dancing-master, had taught young Casanova how to enter a room with a lowly
      and ceremonious bow; and still, though the eighteenth century is drawing
      to a close, old Casanova enters the rooms of Dux with the same stately
      bow, but now everyone laughs. Old Casanova treads the grave measures of
      the minuet; they applauded his dancing once, but now everyone laughs.
      Young Casanova was always dressed in the height of the fashion; but the
      age of powder, wigs, velvets, and silks has departed, and old Casanova&rsquo;s
      attempts at elegance (&ldquo;Strass&rdquo; diamonds have replaced the genuine stones
      with him) are likewise greeted with laughter. No wonder the old adventurer
      denounces the whole house of Jacobins and canaille; the world, he feels,
      is permanently out of joint for him; everything is cross, and everyone is
      in a conspiracy to drive the iron into his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last these persecutions, real or imaginary, drive him away from Dux; he
      considers his genius bids him go, and, as before, he obeys. Casanova has
      but little pleasure or profit out of this his last journey; he has to
      dance attendance in ante-chambers; no one will give him any office,
      whether as tutor, librarian, or chamberlain. In one quarter only is he
      well received&mdash;namely, by the famous Duke of Weimar; but in a few
      days he becomes madly jealous of the duke&rsquo;s more famous proteges, Goethe
      and Wieland, and goes off declaiming against them and German literature
      generally&mdash;with which literature he was wholly unacquainted. From
      Weimar to Berlin; where there are Jews to whom he has introductions.
      Casanova thinks them ignorant, superstitious, and knavish; but they lend
      him money, and he gives bills on Count Wallenstein, which are paid. In six
      weeks the wanderer returns to Dux, and is welcomed with open arms; his
      journeys are over at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not his troubles. A week after his return there are strawberries at
      dessert; everyone is served before himself, and when the plate comes round
      to him it is empty. Worse still: his portrait is missing from his room,
      and is discovered &lsquo;salement placarde a la porte des lieux d&rsquo;aisance&rsquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Five more years of life remained to him. They were passed in such petty
      mortifications as we have narrated, in grieving over his &lsquo;afreuse
      vieillesse&rsquo;, and in laments over the conquest of his native land Venice,
      once so splendid and powerful. His appetite began to fail, and with it
      failed his last source of pleasure, so death came to him somewhat as a
      release. He received the sacraments with devotion, exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grand Dieu, et vous tous temoins de ma mort, j&rsquo;ai vecu en philosophe, et
      je meurs en Chretien,&rdquo; and so died.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a quiet ending to a wonderfully brilliant and entirely useless
      career. It has been suggested that if the age in which Casanova lived had
      been less corrupt, he himself might have used his all but universal
      talents to some advantage, but to our mind Casanova would always have
      remained Casanova. He came of a family of adventurers, and the reader of
      his Memoirs will remark how he continually ruined his prospects by his
      ineradicable love for disreputable company. His &ldquo;Bohemianism&rdquo; was in his
      blood, and in his old age he regrets&mdash;not his past follies, but his
      inability to commit folly any longer. Now and again we are inclined to
      pronounce Casanova to be an amiable man; and if to his generosity and good
      nature he had added some elementary knowledge of the distinction between
      right and wrong, he might certainly have laid some claim to the character.
      The Prince de Ligne draws the following portrait of him under the name of
      Aventuros:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;He would be a handsome man if he were not ugly; he is tall and strongly
built, but his dark complexion and his glittering eyes give him a fierce
expression. He is easier to annoy than amuse; he laughs little but makes
others laugh by the peculiar turn he gives to his conversation. He knows
everything except those matters on the knowledge of which he chiefly
prides himself, namely, dancing, the French language, good taste, and
knowledge of the world. Everything about him is comic, except his
comedies; and all his writings are philosophical, saving those which
treat of philosophy. He is a perfect well of knowledge, but he quotes
Homer and Horace ad nauseam.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      I &mdash; CASANOVA&rsquo;S RETURN TO VENICE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thus Casanova ended his Memoirs, concluding his narrative with his sojourn
      at Trieste, in January 1774, where he had remained, except for a few
      excursions, since the 15th November 1772. He was forty-nine years of age.
      Since his unfortunate experiences in England, the loss of his fortune and
      the failure of his efforts to obtain congenial and remunerative employment
      in Germany or Russia, he had come to concentrate his efforts on a return
      to his native city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of his faithful friends, the nobles Bragadin, Barbaro and Dandolo, the
      first had died in 1767, having gone into debt &ldquo;that I might have enough,&rdquo;
       sending Casanova, from his death-bed, a last gift of a thousand crowns.
      Barbaro who had died also, in 1771, left Casanova a life-income of six
      sequins a month. The survivor, Dandolo, was poor, but until his death, he
      also gave Casanova a monthly provision of six sequins. However, Casanova
      was not without influential friends who might not only obtain a pardon
      from the State Inquisitors but also assist him to employment; and, in
      fact, it was through such influence as that wielded by the Avogador Zaguri
      and the Procurator Morosini, that Casanova received his pardon, and later,
      a position as &ldquo;Confidant,&rdquo; or Secret Agent, to the Inquisitors at Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Casanova re-entered Venice the 14th September 1774 and, presenting
      himself, on the 18th, to Marc-Antoine Businello, Secretary of the Tribunal
      of the Inquisitors of State, was advised that mercy had been accorded him
      by reason of his refutation of the History of the Venetian Government by
      Amelot de la Houssaie which he had written during his forty-two day
      imprisonment at Barcelona in 1768. The three Inquisitors, Francesco
      Grimani, Francesco Sagredo and Paolo Bembo, invited him to dinner to hear
      his story of his escape from The Leads.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1772, Bandiera, the Republic&rsquo;s resident at Ancona, drew this portrait
      of Casanova:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One sees everywhere this unhappy rebel against the justice of the August
      Council, presenting himself boldly, his head carried high, and well
      equipped. He is received in many houses and announces his intention of
      going to Trieste and, from there, of returning to Germany. He is a man of
      forty years or more,&rdquo; [in reality, forty-seven] &ldquo;of high stature and
      excellent appearance, vigorous, of a very brown color, the eye bright, the
      wig short and chestnut-brown. He is said to be haughty and disdainful; he
      speaks at length, with spirit and erudition.&rdquo; [Letter of information to
      the Very Illustrious Giovanni Zon, Secretary of the August Council of Ten
      at Venice. 2 October 1772.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to Venice after an absence of eighteen years, Casanova renewed
      his acquaintance with many old friends, among whom were:
    </p>
    <p>
      The Christine of the Memoirs. Charles, who married Christine, the marriage
      being arranged by Casanova while in Venice in 1747, was of financial
      assistance to Casanova, who &ldquo;found him a true friend.&rdquo; Charles died &ldquo;a few
      months before my last departure from Venice,&rdquo; in 1783.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mlle. X&mdash;&mdash; C&mdash;&mdash; V&mdash;&mdash;, really Giustina de
      Wynne, widow of the Count Rosenberg, Austrian Ambassador at Venice.
      &ldquo;Fifteen years afterwards, I saw her again and she was a widow, happy
      enough, apparently, and enjoying a great reputation on account of her
      rank, wit and social qualities, but our connection was never renewed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Callimena, who was kind to him &ldquo;for love&rsquo;s sake alone&rdquo; at Sorrento in
      1770.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marcoline, the girl he took away from his younger brother, the Abby
      Casanova, at Geneva in 1763.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Balbi, the companion of his flight from The Leads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Gozzi, his former teacher at Padua, now become Arch-Priest of St.
      George of the Valley, and his sister Betting. &ldquo;When I went to pay him a
      visit . . . she breathed her last in my arms, in 1776, twenty-four hours
      after my arrival. I will speak of her death in due time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Angela Toselli, his first passion. In 1758 this girl married the advocate
      Francesco Barnaba Rizzotti, and in the following year she gave birth to a
      daughter, Maria Rizzotti (later married to a M. Kaiser) who lived at
      Vienna and whose letters to Casanova were preserved at Dux.
    </p>
    <p>
      C&mdash;&mdash; C&mdash;&mdash;, the young girl whose love affair with
      Casanova became involved with that of the nun M&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;
      Casanova found her in Venice &ldquo;a widow and poorly off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dancing girl Binetti, who assisted Casanova in his flight from
      Stuttgart in 1760, whom he met again in London in 1763, and who was the
      cause of his duel with Count Branicki at Warsaw in 1766. She danced
      frequently at Venice between 1769 and 1780.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good and indulgent Mme. Manzoni, &ldquo;of whom I shall have to speak very
      often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The patricians Andrea Memmo and his brother Bernardo who, with P. Zaguri
      were personages of considerable standing in the Republic and who remained
      his constant friends. Andrea Memmo was the cause of the embarrassment in
      which Mlle. X&mdash;&mdash; C&mdash;&mdash; V&mdash;&mdash; found herself
      in Paris and which Casanova vainly endeavored to remove by applications of
      his astonishing specific, the &lsquo;aroph of Paracelsus&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the house of these friends that Casanova became acquainted with
      the poet, Lorenzo Da Ponte. &ldquo;I made his acquaintance,&rdquo; says the latter, in
      his own Memoirs, &ldquo;at the house of Zaguri and the house of Memmo, who both
      sought after his always interesting conversation, accepting from this man
      all he had of good, and closing their eyes, on account of his genius, upon
      the perverse parts of his nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lorenzo Da Ponte, known above all as Mozart&rsquo;s librettist, and whose youth
      much resembled that of Casanova, was accused of having eaten ham on Friday
      and was obliged to flee from Venice in 1777, to escape the punishment of
      the Tribunal of Blasphemies. In his Memoirs, he speaks unsparingly of his
      compatriot and yet, as M. Rava notes, in the numerous letters he wrote
      Casanova, and which were preserved at Dux, he proclaims his friendship and
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene Rinaldi, whom he met again at Padua in 1777, with her daughter who
      &ldquo;had become a charming girl; and our acquaintance was renewed in the
      tenderest manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ballet-girl Adelaide, daughter of Mme. Soavi, who was also a dancer,
      and of a M. de Marigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara, who attracted Casanova&rsquo;s attention at Trieste, in 1773, while he
      was frequenting a family named Leo, but toward whom he had maintained an
      attitude of respect. This girl, on meeting him again in 1777, declared
      that &ldquo;she had guessed my real feelings and had been amused by my foolish
      restraint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At Pesaro, the Jewess Leah, with whom he had the most singular experiences
      at Ancona in 1772.

    <h2>
      II &mdash; RELATIONS WITH THE INQUISITORS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soon after reaching Venice, Casanova learned that the Landgrave of Hesse
      Cassel, following the example of other German princes, wished a Venetian
      correspondent for his private affairs. Through some influence he believed
      he might obtain this small employment; but before applying for the
      position he applied to the Secretary of the Tribunal for permission.
      Apparently nothing came of this, and Casanova obtained no definite
      employment until 1776.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in 1776, Casanova entered the service of the Tribunal of Inquisitors
      as an &ldquo;occasional Confidant,&rdquo; under the fictitious name of Antonio
      Pratiloni, giving his address as &ldquo;at the Casino of S. E. Marco Dandolo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In October 1780, his appointment was more definitely established and he
      was given a salary of fifteen ducats a month. This, with the six sequins
      of life-income left by Barbaro and the six given by Dandolo, gave him a
      monthly income of three hundred and eighty-four lires&mdash;about
      seventy-four U. S. dollars&mdash;from 1780 until his break with the
      Tribunal at the end of 1781.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Archives of Venice are preserved forty-eight letters from Casanova,
      including the Reports he wrote as a &ldquo;Confidant,&rdquo; all in the same
      handwriting as the manuscript of the Memoirs. The Reports may be divided
      into two classes: those referring to commercial or industrial matters, and
      those referring to the public morals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those of the first class, we find:
    </p>
    <p>
      A Report relating to Casanova&rsquo;s success in having a change made in the
      route of the weekly diligence running from Trieste to Mestre, for which
      service, rendered during Casanova&rsquo;s residence at Trieste in 1773, he
      received encouragement and the sum of one hundred ducats from the
      Tribunal.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Report, the 8th September 1776, with information concerning the rumored
      project of the future Emperor of Austria to invade Dalmatia after the
      death of Maria Theresa. Casanova stated he had received this information
      from a Frenchman, M. Salz de Chalabre, whom he had known in Paris twenty
      years before. This M. Chalabre [printed Calabre] was the pretended nephew
      of Mme. Amelin. &ldquo;This young man was as like her as two drops of water, but
      she did not find that a sufficient reason for avowing herself his mother.&rdquo;
       The boy was, in fact, the son of Mme. Amelin and of M. de Chalabre, who
      had lived together for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Report, the 12th of December 1776, of a secret mission to Trieste, in
      regard to a project of the court of Vienna for making Fiume a French port;
      the object being to facilitate communications between this port and the
      interior of Hungary. For this inquiry, Casanova received sixteen hundred
      lires, his expenditures amounting to seven hundred and sixty-six lires.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Report, May-July 1779, of an excursion in the market of Ancona for
      information concerning the commercial relations of the Pontifical States
      with the Republic of Venice. At Forli, in the course of this excursion,
      Casanova visited the dancing-girl Binetti. For this mission Casanova
      received forty-eight sequins.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Report, January 1780, remarking a clandestine recruiting carried out by
      a certain Marrazzani for the [Prussian] regiment of Zarembal.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Report, the 11th October 1781, regarding a so-called Baldassare
      Rossetti, a Venetian subject living at Trieste, whose activities and
      projects were of a nature to prejudice the commerce and industry of the
      Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the Reports relating to public morals may be noted:
    </p>
    <p>
      December 1776. A Report on the seditious character of a ballet called
      &ldquo;Coriolanus.&rdquo; The back of this report is inscribed: &ldquo;The impressario of S.
      Benedetto, Mickel de l&rsquo;Agata, shall be summoned immediately; it has been
      ordered that he cease, under penalty of his life, from giving the ballet
      Coriolanus at the theater. Further, he is to collect and deposit all the
      printed programmes of this ballet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      December 1780. A Report calling to the attention of the Tribunal the
      scandalous disorders produced in the theaters when the lights were
      extinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      3rd May 1781. A Report remarking that the Abbe Carlo Grimani believed
      himself exempt, in his position as a priest, from the interdiction laid on
      patricians against frequenting foreign ministers and their suites. On the
      back of this Report is written: &ldquo;Ser Jean Carlo, Abbe Grimani, to be
      gently reminded, by the Secretary, of the injunction to abstain from all
      commerce with foreign ministers and their adherents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Venetian nobles were forbidden under penalty of death from holding any
      communication with foreign ambassadors or their households. This was
      intended as a precaution to preserve the secrets of the Senate.
    </p>
    <p>
      26th November 1781. A Report concerning a painting academy where nude
      studies were made, from models of both sexes, while scholars only twelve
      or thirteen years of age were admitted, and where dilettantes who were
      neither painters nor designers, attended the sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      22nd December 1781. By order, Casanova reported to the Tribunal a list of
      the principal licentious or antireligious books to be found in the
      libraries and private collections at Venice: la Pucelle; la Philosophie de
      l&rsquo;Histoire; L&rsquo;Esprit d&rsquo;Helvetius; la Sainte Chandelle d&rsquo;Arras; les Bijoux
      indiscrets; le Portier des Chartreux; les Posies de Baffo; Ode a Priape;
      de Piron; etc., etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      In considering this Report, which has been the subject of violent
      criticism, we should bear in mind three points:
    </p>
    <p>
      first&mdash;the Inquisitors required this information; second&mdash;no one
      in their employ could have been in a better position to give it than
      Casanova; third&mdash;Casanova was morally and economically bound, as an
      employee of the Tribunal, to furnish the information ordered, whatever his
      personal distaste for the undertaking may have been. We may even assume
      that he permitted himself to express his feelings in some indiscreet way,
      and his break with the Tribunal followed, for, at the end of 1781, his
      commission was withdrawn. Certainly, Casanova&rsquo;s almost absolute dependence
      on his salary, influenced the letter he wrote the Inquisitors at this
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Illustrious and Most Excellent Lords, the Inquisitors of State:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Filled with confusion, overwhelmed with sorrow and repentance,
      recognizing myself absolutely unworthy of addressing my vile letter to
      Your Excellencies confessing that I have failed in my duty in the
      opportunities which presented themselves, I, Jacques Casanova, invoke, on
      my knees, the mercy of the Prince; I beg that, in compassion and grace,
      there may be accorded me that which, in all justice and on reflection, may
      be refused me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask the Sovereign Munificence to come to my aid, so that, with the
      means of subsistence, I may apply myself vigorously, in the future, to the
      service to which I have been privileged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After this respectful supplication, the wisdom of Your Excellencies may
      judge the disposition of my spirit and of my intentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Inquisitors decided to award Casanova one month&rsquo;s pay, but specified
      that thereafter he would receive salary only when he rendered important
      services.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1782 Casanova made a few more Reports to the Tribunal, for one of
      which, regarding the failure of an insurance and commercial house at
      Trieste, he received six sequins. But the part of a guardian of the public
      morals, even through necessity, was undoubtedly unpleasant to him; and, in
      spite of the financial loss, it may be that his release was a relief.

    <h2>
      III &mdash; FRANCESCA BUSCHINI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Intimately connected with Casanova&rsquo;s life at this period was a girl named
      Francesca Buschini. This name does not appear in any of the literary,
      artistic or theatrical records of the period, and, of the girl, nothing is
      known other than that which she herself tells us in her letters to
      Casanova. From these very human letters, however, we may obtain, not only
      certain facts, but also, a very excellent idea of her character.
      Thirty-two of her letters, dated between July 1779 and October 1787,
      written in the Venetian dialect, were preserved in the library at Dux.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a seamstress, although often without work, and had a brother, a
      younger sister and also a mother living with her. The probabilities are
      that she was a girl of the most usual sort, but greatly attached to
      Casanova who, even in his poverty, must have dazzled her as a being from
      another world. She was his last Venetian love, and remained a faithful
      correspondent until 1787; and it is chiefly from her letters, in which she
      comments on news contained in Casanova&rsquo;s letters to her, that light is
      thrown on the Vienna-Paris period, particularly, of Casanova&rsquo;s life. For
      this, Francesca has placed us greatly in her debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this girl, at least between 1779 and 1782, Casanova rented a small
      house at Barbaria delle Tole, near S. Giustina, from the noble Pesaro at
      S. Stae. Casanova, always in demand for his wit and learning, often took
      dinner in the city. He knew that a place always awaited him at the house
      of Memmo and at that of Zaguri and that, at the table of these patricians,
      who were distinguished by their intellectual superiority, he would meet
      men notable in science and letters. Being so long and so closely connected
      with theatrical circles, he was often seen at the theater, with Francesca.
      Thus, the 9th August 1786, the poor girl, in an excess of chagrin writes:
      &ldquo;Where are all the pleasures which formerly you procured me? Where are the
      theatres, the comedies which we once saw together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the 28th July 1779, Francesca wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest and best beloved,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo; . . . In the way of novelties, I find nothing except that S. E. Pietro
      Zaguri has arrived at Venice; his servant has been twice to ask for you,
      and I have said you were still at the Baths of Abano . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Casanova-Buschini establishment kept up relations, more or less
      frequent and intimate, with a few persons, most of whom are mentioned in
      Francesca&rsquo;s letters; the Signora Anzoletta Rizzotti; the Signora Elisabeth
      Catrolli, an ancient comedienne; the Signora Bepa Pezzana; the Signora
      Zenobia de Monti, possibly the mother of that Carlo de Monti, Venetian
      Consul at Trieste, who was a friend to Casanova and certainly contributed
      toward obtaining his pardon from the Inquisitors; a M. Lunel, master of
      languages, and his wife.

      IV &mdash; PUBLICATIONS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Casanova&rsquo;s principal writings during this period were:
    </h3>
    <p>
      His translation of the Iliad, the first volume of which was issued in
      1775, the second in 1777 and the third in 1778.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his stay at Abano in 1778, he wrote the Scrutinio del libro,
      eulogies of M. de Voltaire &ldquo;by various hands.&rdquo; In the dedication of this
      book, to the Doge Renier, he wrote, &ldquo;This little book has recently come
      from my inexperienced pen, in the hours of leisure which are frequent at
      Abano for those who do not come only for the baths.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From January until July 1780, he published, anonymously, a series of
      miscellaneous small works, seven pamphlets of about one hundred pages

      From the 7th October to the end of December, 1780, on the occasions of the
      representations given by a troupe of French comedians at the San Angelo
      theater, Casanova wrote a little paper called The Messenger of Thalia. In
      one of the numbers, he wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;French is not my tongue; I make no pretentions and, wrong or astray, I
      place on the paper what heaven sends from my pen. I give birth to phrases
      turned to Italian, either to see what they look like or to produce a
      style, and often, also, to draw, into a purist&rsquo;s snare, some critical
      doctor who does not know my humor or how my offense amuses me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;little romance&rdquo; referred to in the following letter to &ldquo;Mlle. X&mdash;&mdash;
      C&mdash;&mdash; V&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; appeared in 1782, with the title; &lsquo;Di
      anecdoti vinizani militari a amorosi del secolo decimo quarto sotto i
      dogati di Giovanni Gradenigoe di Giovanni Dolfin&rsquo;. Venezia, 1782.

    <h2>
      V &mdash; MLLE. X . . . C . . . V. . .
    </h2>
    <p>
      In 1782, a letter written by this lady, Giustina de Wynne, referring to a
      visit to Venice of Paul I, Grand Duke, afterward Emperor of Russia, and
      his wife, was published under the title of Du sejour des Comptes du Nord a
      Venise en janvier mdcclxxxii. If he had not previously done so, Casanova
      took this occasion to recall himself to the memory of this lady to whom he
      had once been of such great service. And two very polite letters were
      exchanged:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fine epistle which V. E. has allowed to be printed upon the sojourn
      of C. and of the C. du Nord in this city, exposes you, in the position of
      an author, to endure the compliments of all those who trouble themselves
      to write. But I flatter myself, Madam, that V. E. will not disdain mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little romance, Madam, a translation from my dull and rigid pen, is
      not a gift but a very paltry offering which I dare make to the superiority
      of your merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have found, Madam, in your letter, the simple, flowing style of
      gentility, the one which alone a woman of condition who writes to her
      friend may use with dignity. Your digressions and your thoughts are
      flowers which . . . (forgive an author who pilfers from you the delicious
      nonchalance of an amiable writer) or . . . a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp which, from
      time to time, issues from the work, in spite of the author, and burns the
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I aspire, Madam, to render myself favorable to the deity to which reason
      advises me to make homage. Accept then the offering and render happy he
      who makes it with your indulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the honor to sign myself, if you will kindly permit me, with very
      profound respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Giacomo Casanova.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sensible, Monsieur, of the distinction which comes to me from
      your approbation of my little pamphlet. The interest of the moment, its
      references and the exaltation of spirits have gained for it the tolerance
      and favorable welcome of the good Venetians. It is to your politeness in
      particular, Monsieur, that I believe is due the marked success which my
      work has had with you. I thank you for the book which you sent me and I
      will risk thanking you in advance for the pleasure it will give me. Be
      persuaded of my esteem for yourself and for your talents. And I have the
      honor to be, Monsieur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your very humble servant de Wynne de Rosemberg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Among Casanova&rsquo;s papers at Dux was a page headed &ldquo;Souvenir,&rdquo; dated the 2nd
      September 1791, and beginning: &ldquo;While descending the staircase, the Prince
      de Rosemberg told me that Madame de Rosemberg was dead . . . . This Prince
      de Rosemberg was the nephew of Giustina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giustina died, after a long illness, at Padua, the 21st August 1791, at
      the age of fifty-four years and seven months.

    <h2>
      VI &mdash; LAST DAYS AT VENICE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Toward the end of 1782, doubtless convinced that he could expect nothing
      more from the Tribunal, Casanova entered the service of the Marquis
      Spinola as a secretary. Some years before, a certain Carletti, an officer
      in the service of the court of Turin, had won from the Marquis a wager of
      two hundred and fifty sequins. The existence of this debt seemed to have
      completely disappeared from the memory of the loser. By means of the firm
      promise of a pecuniary recompense, Casanova intervened to obtain from his
      patron a written acknowledgment of the debt owing to Carletti. His effort
      was successful; but instead of clinking cash, Carletti contented himself
      with remitting to the negotiator an assignment on the amount of the
      credit. Casanova&rsquo;s anger caused a violent dispute, in the course of which
      Carlo Grimani, at whose house the scene took place, placed him in the
      wrong and imposed silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The irascible Giacomo conceived a quick resentment. To discharge his bile,
      he found nothing less than to publish in the course of the month of
      August, under the title of: &lsquo;Ne amori ne donne ovvero la Stalla d&rsquo;Angia
      repulita&rsquo;, a libel in which Jean Carlo Grimani, Carletti, and other
      notable persons were outraged under transparent mythological pseudonyms.
    </p>
    <p>
      This writing embroiled the author with the entire body of the Venetian
      nobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      To allow the indignation against him to quiet down, Casanova went to pass
      some days at Trieste, then returned to Venice to put his affairs in order.
      The idea of recommencing his wandering life alarmed him. &ldquo;I have lived
      fifty-eight years,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;I could not go on foot with winter at hand,
      and when I think of starting on the road to resume my adventurous life, I
      laugh at myself in the mirror.&rdquo;

    </h2>
    <h3>
      TRAVELS IN 1783
    </h3>
    <p>
      Casanova left Venice in January 1783, and went to Vienna.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 16th April Elisabeth Catrolli wrote to him at Vienna:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest of friends,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your letter has given me great pleasure. Be assured, I infinitely regret
      your departure. I have but two sincere friends, yourself and Camerani. I
      do not hope for more. I could be happy if I could have at least one of you
      near me to whom I could confide my cruel anxieties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day, I received from Camerani a letter informing me that, in a former
      one, he had sent me a bill of exchange: I did not receive it, and I fear
      it has been lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear friend, when you reach Paris, clasp him to your heart for me . . .
      In regard to Chechina [Francesca Buschini] I would say that I have not
      seen her since the day I took her your letter. Her mother is the ruin of
      that poor girl; let that suffice; I will say no more . . . . &rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After leaving Venice, Casanova apparently took an opportunity to pay his
      last disrespects to the Tribunal. At least, in May 1783, M. Schlick,
      French Secretary at Venice, wrote to Count Vergennes: &ldquo;Last week there
      reached the State Inquisitors an anonymous letter stating that, on the
      25th of this month, an earthquake, more terrible than that of Messina,
      would raze Venice to the ground. This letter has caused a panic here. Many
      patricians have left the capital and others will follow their example. The
      author of the anonymous letter . . . is a certain Casanova, who wrote from
      Vienna and found means to slip it into the Ambassador&rsquo;s own mails.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In about four months, Casanova was again on the way to Italy. He paused
      for a week at Udine and arrived at Venice on the 16th June. Without
      leaving his barge, he paused at his house just long enough to salute
      Francesca. He left Mestre on Tuesday the 24th June and on the same day
      dined at the house of F. Zanuzzi at Bassano. On the 25th he left Bassano
      by post and arrived in the evening at Borgo di Valsugano.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 29th, he wrote to Francesca from the Augsbourg. He had stopped at
      Innsbruck to attend the theater and was in perfect health. He had reached
      Frankfort in forty-eight hours, traveling eighteen posts without stopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Aix-la-Chapelle, on the 16th July, he wrote Francesca that he had
      met, in that city, Cattina, the wife of Pocchini. Pocchini was sick and in
      deep misery. Casanova, recalling all the abominable tricks this rogue had
      played on him refused Cattina the assistance she begged for in tears,
      laughed in her face, and said: &ldquo;Farewell, I wish you a pleasant death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At Mayence, Casanova embarked on the Rhine in company with the Marquis
      Durazzo, former Austrian Ambassador at Venice. The voyage was excellent
      and in two days he arrived at Cologne, in rugged health, sleeping well and
      eating like a wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 30th July he wrote to Francesca from Spa and in this letter
      enclosed a good coin. Everything was dear at Spa; his room cost eight
      lires a day with everything else in proportion.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 6th September he wrote from Antwerp to one of his good friends, the
      Abbe Eusebio della Lena, telling him that at Spa an English woman who had
      a passion for speaking Latin wished to submit him to trials which he
      judged it unnecessary to state precisely. He refused all her proposals,
      saying, however, that he would not reveal them to anyone; but that he did
      not feel he should refuse also &ldquo;an order on her banker for twenty-five
      guineas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the 9th he wrote to Francesca from Brussels, and on the 12th he sent
      her a bill of exchange on the banker Corrado for one hundred and fifty
      lires. He said he had been intoxicated &ldquo;because his reputation had
      required it.&rdquo; &ldquo;This greatly astonishes me,&rdquo; Francesca responded, &ldquo;for I
      have never seen you intoxicated nor even illuminated . . . . I am very
      happy that the wine drove away the inflammation in your teeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Practically all information of Casanova&rsquo;s movements in 1783 and 1784 is
      obtained from Francesca&rsquo;s letters which were in the library at Dux.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her letters of the 27th June and 11th July, Francesca wrote Casanova
      that she had directed the Jew Abraham to sell Casanova&rsquo;s satin habit and
      velvet breeches, but could not hope for more than fifty lires because they
      were patched. Abraham had observed that at one time the habit had been
      placed in pledge with him by Casanova for three sequins.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 6th September, she wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With great pleasure, I reply to the three dear letters which you wrote me
      from Spa: the first of the 6th August, from which I learned that your
      departure had been delayed for some days to wait for someone who was to
      arrive in that city. I was happy that your appetite had returned, because
      good cheer is your greatest pleasure . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your second letter which you wrote me from Spa on the 16th August, I
      noted with sorrow that your affairs were not going as you wished. But
      console yourself, dear friend, for happiness will come after trouble; at
      least, I wish it so, also, for you yourself can imagine in what need I
      find myself, I and all my family . . . . I have no work, because I have
      not the courage to ask it of anyone. My mother has not earned even enough
      to pay for the gold thread with the little cross which you know I love.
      Necessity made me sell it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I received your last letter of the 20th August from Spa with another
      letter for S. E. the Procurator Morosini. You directed me to take it to
      him myself, and on Sunday the last day of August, I did not fail to go
      there exactly at three o&rsquo;clock. At once on my arrival, I spoke to a
      servant who admitted me without delay; but, my dear friend, I regret
      having to send you an unpleasant message. As soon as I handed him the
      letter, and before he even opened it, he said to me, &lsquo;I always know
      Casanova&rsquo;s affairs which trouble me.&rsquo; After having read hardly more than a
      page, he said: &lsquo;I know not what to do!&rsquo; I told him that, on the 6th of
      this month, I was to write you at Paris and that, if he would do me the
      honor of giving me his reply, I would put it in my letter. Imagine what
      answer he gave me! I was much surprised! He told me that I should wish you
      happiness but that he would not write to you again. He said no more. I
      kissed his hands and left. He did not give me even a sou. That is all he
      said to me . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S. E. Pietro Zaguri sent to me to ask if I knew where you were, because
      he had written two letters to Spa and had received no reply . . . .&rdquo;

    <h2>
      II &mdash; PARIS
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the night of the 18th or 19th September 1783, Casanova arrived at
      Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 30th he wrote Francesca that he had been well received by his
      sister-in-law and by his brother, Francesco Casanova, the painter. Nearly
      all his friends had departed for the other world, and he would now have to
      make new ones, which would be difficult as he was no longer pleasing to
      the women.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 14th October he wrote again, saying that he was in good health and
      that Paris was a paradise which made him feel twenty years old. Four
      letters followed; in the first, dated from Paris on S. Martin&rsquo;s Day, he
      told Francesco not to reply for he did not know whether he would prolong
      his visit nor where he might go. Finding no fortune in Paris, he said he
      would go and search elsewhere. On the 23rd, he sent one hundred and fifty
      lires; &ldquo;a true blessing,&rdquo; to the poor girl who was always short of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between times, Casanova passed eight days at Fontainebleau, where he met
      &ldquo;a charming young man of twenty-five,&rdquo; the son of &ldquo;the young and lovely
      O-Morphi&rdquo; who indirectly owed to him her position, in 1752, as the
      mistress of Louis XV. &ldquo;I wrote my name on his tablets and begged him to
      present my compliments to his mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He also met, in the same place, his own son by Mme. Dubois, his former
      housekeeper at Soleure who had married the good M. Lebel. &ldquo;We shall hear
      of the young gentleman in twenty-one years at Fontainebleau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I paid my third visit to Paris, with the intention of ending my days
      in that capital, I reckoned on the friendship of M. d&rsquo;Alembert, but he
      died, like, Fontenelle, a fortnight after my arrival, toward the end of
      1783.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is interesting to know that, at this time, Casanova met his famous
      contemporary, Benjamin Franklin. &ldquo;A few days after the death of the
      illustrious d&rsquo;Alembert,&rdquo; Casanova assisted, at the old Louvre, in a
      session of the Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. &ldquo;Seated beside
      the learned Franklin, I was a little surprised to hear Condorcet ask him
      if he believed that one could give various directions to an air balloon.
      This was the response: &lsquo;The matter is still in its infancy, so we must
      wait.&rsquo; I was surprised. It is not believable that the great philosopher
      could ignore the fact that it would be impossible to give the machine any
      other direction than that governed by the air which fills it, but these
      people &lsquo;nil tam verentur, quam ne dubitare aliqua de re videantur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the 13th November, Casanova left Paris in company with his brother,
      Francesco, whose wife did not accompany him. &ldquo;His new wife drove him away
      from Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now [1797 or 1798] I feel that I have seen Paris and France for the last
      time. That popular effervescence [the French Revolution] has disgusted me
      and I am too old to hope to see the end of it.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      III &mdash; VIENNA
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the 29th November, Casanova wrote from Frankfort that a drunken
      postilion had upset him and in the fall he had dislocated his left
      shoulder, but that a good bone-setter had restored it to place. On the 1st
      December he wrote that he was healed, having taken medicine and having
      been blooded. He promised to send Francesca eight sequins to pay her rent.
      He reached Vienna about the 7th of December and on the 15th sent Francesco
      a bill of exchange for eight sequins and two lires.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the last day of 1783, Francesca wrote to him at Vienna:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see by your good letter that you will go to Dresden and then to Berlin
      and that you will return to Vienna the 10th January . . . . I am
      astonished, my dear friend, at the great journeys you make in this cold
      weather, but, still, you are a great man, big-hearted, full of spirit and
      courage; you travel in this terrible cold as though it were nothing . . .
      . &rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the 9th January, Casanova wrote from Dessau to his brother Giovanni,
      proposing to make peace with him, but without results. On the 27th, he was
      at Prague. By the 16th February, he was again in Vienna, after a trip
      lasting sixty-two days. His health was perfect, and he had gained flesh
      due, as he wrote Francesca, to his contented mind which was no longer
      tormented.
    </p>
    <p>
      In February, he entered the service of M. Foscarini, Venetian Ambassador,
      &ldquo;to write dispatches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the 10th March, Francesca wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest of Friends, I reply at once to your good letter of the 28th
      February which I received Sunday . . . . I thank you for your kindness
      which makes you say that you love me and that when you have money you will
      send me some . . . but that at the moment you are dry as a salamander. I
      do not know what sort of animal that is. But as for me I am certainly dry
      of money and I am consumed with the hope of having some . . . . I see that
      you were amused at the Carnival and that you were four times at the masked
      ball, where there were two hundred women, and that you danced minuets and
      quadrilles to the great astonishment of the ambassador Foscarini who told
      everyone that you were sixty years old, although in reality you have not
      yet reached your sixtieth year. You might well laugh at that and say that
      he must be blind to have such an idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that you assisted, with your brother, at a grand dinner at the
      Ambassador&rsquo;s . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that you have read my letters to your brother and that he salutes
      me. Make him my best compliments and thank him. You ask me to advise you
      whether, if he should happen to return to Venice with you, he could lodge
      with you in your house. Tell him yes, because the chickens are always in
      the loft and make no dirt; and, as for the dogs, one watches to see that
      they do not make dirt. The furniture of the apartment is already in place;
      it lacks only a wardrobe and the little bed which you bought for your
      nephew and the mirror; as for the rest, everything is as you left it. . .
      .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is possible that, at the &ldquo;grand dinner,&rdquo; Casanova was presented to
      Count Waldstein, without whose kindness to Casanova the Memoirs probably
      would never have been written. The Lord of Dux, Joseph Charles Emmanuel
      Waldstein-Wartenberg, Chamberlain to Her Imperial Majesty, descendant of
      the great Wallenstein, was the elder of the eleven children of Emmanuel
      Philibert, Count Waldstein, and Maria Theresa, Princess Liechtenstein.
      Very egotistic and willful in his youth, careless of his affairs, and an
      imprudent gambler, at thirty years of age he had not yet settled down. His
      mother was disconsolated that her son could not separate himself from
      occupations &ldquo;so little suited to his spirit and his birth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the 13th March 1784, Count Lamberg wrote Casanova: &ldquo;I know M. le C. de
      Waldstein through having heard him praised by judges worthy of
      appreciating the transcendent qualities of more than one kind peculiar to
      the Count. I congratulate you on having such a Maecenas, and I
      congratulate him in his turn on having chosen such a man as yourself.&rdquo;
       Which last remark certainly foreshadows the library at Dux.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, on the lath March, 1785, Zaguri wrote: &ldquo;In two months at the
      latest, all will be settled. I am very happy.&rdquo; Referring further, it is
      conjectured, to Casanova&rsquo;s hopes of placing himself with the Count.

      IV &mdash; LETTERS FROM FRANCESCA
    </h2>
    <p>
      20th March 1784. &ldquo;I see that you will print one of your books; you say
      that you will send me two hundred copies which I can sell at thirty sous
      each; that you will tell Zaguri and that he will advise those who wish
      copies to apply to me . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This book was the Lettre historico-critique sur un fait connu dependant
      d&rsquo;une cause peu connue, adressee au duc de * * *, 1784.
    </p>
    <p>
      3rd April 1784. &ldquo;I see with pleasure that you have gone to amuse yourself
      in company with two ladies and that you have traveled five posts to see
      the Emperor [Joseph II] . . . . You say that your fortune consists of one
      sequin . . . . I hope that you obtained permission to print your book,
      that you will send me the two hundred copies, and that I may be able to
      sell them. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      14th April 1784. &ldquo;You say that a man without money is the image of death,
      that he is a very wretched animal. I learn with regret that I am unlikely
      to see you at the approaching Festival of the Ascension . . . that you
      hope to see me once more before dying . . . . You make me laugh, telling
      me that at Vienna a balloon was made which arose in the air with six
      persons and that it might be that you would go up also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      28th April 1784. &ldquo;I see, to my lively regret, that you have been in bed
      with your usual ailment [hemorrhoids]. But I am pleased to know that you
      are better. You certainly should go to the baths . . . . I have been
      discouraged in seeing that you have not come to Venice because you have no
      money .... P. S. Just at this moment I have received a good letter,
      enclosing a bill of exchange, which I will go and have paid . . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      5th May 1784. &ldquo;I went to the house of M. Francesco Manenti, at S. Polo di
      Campo, with my bill of exchange, and he gave me at once eighteen pieces of
      ten lires each . . . . I figure that you made fun of me saying seriously
      that you will go up in a balloon and that, if the wind is favorable, you
      will go in the air to Trieste and then from Trieste to Venice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      19th May 1784. &ldquo;I see, to my great regret, that you are in poor health and
      still short of money .... You say that you need twenty sequins and that
      you have only twenty trari . . . . I hope that your book is printed. . .
      .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      29th May 1784. &ldquo;I note with pleasure that you are going to take the baths;
      but I regret that this treatment enfeebles and depresses you. It reassures
      me that you do not fail in your appetite nor your sleep.... I hope I will
      not hear you say again that you are disgusted with everything, and no
      longer in love with life . . . . I see that for you, at this moment,
      fortune sleeps . . . . I am not surprised that everything is so dear in
      the city where you are, for at Venice also one pays dearly and everything
      is priced beyond reach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zaguri wrote Casanova the 12th May, that he had met Francesca in the
      Mongolfieri casino. And on the 2nd June Casanova, doubtless feeling his
      helplessness in the matter of money, and the insufficiency of his
      occasional remittances, and suspicious of Francesca&rsquo;s loyalty, wrote her a
      letter of renunciation. Then came her news of the sale of his books; and
      eighteen months passed before he wrote to her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 12th June 1784, Francesca replied: &ldquo;I could not expect to convey to
      you, nor could you figure, the sorrow that tries me in seeing that you
      will not occupy yourself any more with me . . . . I hid from you that I
      had been with that woman who lived with us, with her companion, the
      cashier of the Academie des Mongolfceristes. Although I went to this
      Academy with prudence and dignity, I did not want to write you for fear
      you would scold me. That is the only reason, and hereafter you may be
      certain of my sincerity and frankness. . . . I beg you to forgive me this
      time, if I write you something I have never written for fear that you
      would be angry with me because I had not told you. Know then that four
      months ago, your books which were on the mezzanine were sold to a library
      for the sum of fifty lires, when we were in urgent need. It was my mother
      who did it. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      26th June 1784. &ldquo;. . . Mme. Zenobia [de Monti] has asked me if I would
      enjoy her company. Certain that you would consent I have allowed her to
      come and live with me. She has sympathy for me and has always loved me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      7th July 1784. &ldquo;Your silence greatly disturbs me! To receive no more of
      your letters! By good post I have sent you three letters, with this one,
      and you have not replied to any of them. Certainly, you have reason for
      being offended at me, because I hid from you something which you learned
      from another . . . . But you might have seen, from my last letter, that I
      have written you all the truth about my fault and that I have asked your
      pardon for not writing it before.... Without you and your help, God knows
      what will become of us.... For the rent of your chamber Mme. Zenobia will
      give us eight lires a month and five lires for preparing her meals. But
      what can one do with thirteen lires! . . . I am afflicted and mortified. .
      . . Do not abandon me.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      V &mdash; LAST DAYS AT VIENNA
    </h2>
    <p>
      In 1785, at Vienna, Casanova ran across Costa, his former secretary who,
      in 1761, had fled from him taking &ldquo;diamonds, watches, snuffbox, linen,
      rich suits and a hundred louis.&rdquo; &ldquo;In 1785, I found this runagate at
      Vienna. He was then Count Erdich&rsquo;s man, and when we come to that period,
      the reader shall hear what I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Casanova did not reach this period, in writing his Memoirs, but an account
      of this meeting is given by Da Ponte, who was present at it, in his
      Memoirs. Costa had met with many misfortunes, as he told Casanova, and had
      himself been defrauded. Casanova threatened to have him hanged, but
      according to Da Ponte, was dissuaded from this by counter accusations made
      by Costa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Da Ponte&rsquo;s narration of the incident is brilliant and amusing, in spite of
      our feeling that it is maliciously exaggerated: &ldquo;Strolling one morning in
      the Graben with Casanova, I suddenly saw him knit his brows, squawk, grind
      his teeth, twist himself, raise his hands skyward, and, snatching himself
      away from me, throw himself on a man whom I seemed to know, shouting with
      a very loud voice: &lsquo;Murderer, I have caught thee.&rsquo; A crowd having gathered
      as a result of this strange act and yell, I approached them with some
      disgust; nevertheless, I caught Casanova&rsquo;s hand and almost by force I
      separated him from the fray. He then told me the story, with desperate
      motions and gestures, and said that his antagonist was Gioachino Costa, by
      whom he had been betrayed. This Gioachino Costa, although he had been
      forced to become a servant by his vices and bad practices, and was at that
      very time servant to a Viennese gentleman, was more or less of a poet. He
      was, in fact, one of those who had honored me with their satire, when the
      Emperor Joseph selected me as poet of his theater. Costa entered a cafe,
      and while I continued to walk with Casanova, wrote and send him by a
      messenger, the following verses:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;&lsquo;Casanova, make no outcry;
   You stole, indeed, as well as I;
   You were the one who first taught me;
   Your art I mastered thoroughly.
   Silence your wisest course will be.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These verses had the desired effect. After a brief silence, Casanova
      laughed and then said softly in my ear: &lsquo;The rogue is right.&rsquo; He went into
      the cafe and motioned to Costa to come out; they began to walk together
      calmly, as if nothing had happened, and they parted shaking hands
      repeatedly and seemingly calm and friendly. Casanova returned to me with a
      cameo on his little finger, which by a strange coincidence, represented
      Mercury, the god-protector of thieves. This was his greatest valuable, and
      it was all that was left of the immense booty, but represented the
      character of the two restored friends, perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Da Ponte precedes this account with a libellous narrative of Casanova&rsquo;s
      relations with the Marquise d&rsquo;Urfe, even stating that Casanova stole from
      her the jewels stolen in turn by Costa, but, as M. Maynial remarks, we may
      attribute this perverted account &ldquo;solely to the rancour and antipathy of
      the narrator.&rdquo; It is more likely that Casanova frightened Costa almost out
      of his wits, was grimly amused at his misfortunes, and let him go, since
      there was no remedy to Casanova&rsquo;s benefit, for his former rascality.
      Casanova&rsquo;s own brief, anticipatory account is given in his Memoirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1797, correcting and revising his Memoirs, Casanova wrote: &ldquo;Twelve
      years ago, if it had not been for my guardian angel, I would have
      foolishly married, at Vienna, a young, thoughtless girl, with whom I had
      fallen in love.&rdquo; In which connection, his remark is interesting: &ldquo;I have
      loved women even to madness, but I have always loved liberty better; and
      whenever I have been in danger of losing it, fate has come to my rescue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While an identification of the &ldquo;young, thoughtless girl&rdquo; has been
      impossible, M. Rava believes her to be &ldquo;C. M.,&rdquo; the subject of a poem
      found at Dux, written in duplicate, in Italian and French, and headed
      &ldquo;Giacomo Casanova, in love, to C. M.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When, Catton, to your sight is shown the love Which all my tenderest
      caresses prove, Feeling all pleasure&rsquo;s sharpest joys and fears, Burning
      one moment, shivering the next, Caressing you while showering you with
      tears, Giving each charm a thousand eager kisses, Wishing to touch at once
      a thousand blisses And, at the ones beyond my power, vexed, Abandoned in a
      furious desire, Leaving these charms for other charms that fire,
      Possessing all and yet desiring Until, destroyed by excesses of pleasure,
      Finding no words of love nor anything To express my fires overflowing
      measure Than deepening sighs and obscure murmuring: Ah! Then you think to
      read my inmost heart To find the love that can these signs impart ....Be
      not deceived. These transports, amorous cries, These kisses, tears,
      desires and heavy sighs, Of all the fire which devours me Could less than
      even the lightest tokens be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evidently this same girl is the authoress of the two following letters
      written by &ldquo;Caton M . . . .&rdquo; to Casanova in 1786.
    </p>
    <p>
      12th April 1786. &ldquo;You will infinitely oblige me if you will tell me to
      whom you wrote such pretty things about me; apparently it is the Abbe Da
      Ponte; but I would go to his house and, either he would prove that you had
      written it or I would have the honor of telling him that he is the most
      infamous traducer in the world. I think that the lovely picture which you
      make of my future has not as much excuse as you may think, and, in spite
      of your science, you deceive yourself.... But just now I will inform you
      of all my wooers and you can judge for yourself by this whether I deserve
      all the reproaches you made me in your last letter. It is two years since
      I came to know the Count de K . . . ; I could have loved him but I was too
      honest to be willing to satisfy his desires . . . . Some months afterward,
      I came to know the Count de M . . . ; he was not so handsome as K . . . ,
      but he possessed every possible art for seducing a girl; I did everything
      for him, but I never loved him as much as his friend. In fine, to tell you
      all my giddinesses in a few words, I set everything right again with K . .
      . . and got myself into a quarrel with M . . . ., then I left K. . . . and
      returned to M . . . ., but at the house of the latter there was always an
      officer who pleased me more than both the two others and who sometimes
      conducted me to the house; then we found ourselves at the house of a
      friend, and it is of this same officer that I am ill. So, my dear friend,
      that is all. I do not seek to justify my past conduct; on the contrary, I
      know well that I have acted badly.... I am much afflicted at being the
      cause of your remaining away from Venice during the Carnival . . . . I
      hope to see you soon again and am, with much love,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, your sincere
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caton M. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      16th July 1786. &ldquo;I have spoken with the Abbe Da Ponte. He invited me to
      come to his house because, he said, he had something to tell me for you. I
      went there, but was received so coldly that I am resolved not to go there
      again. Also, Mlle. Nanette affected an air of reserve and took at on
      herself to read me lessons on what she was pleased to call my libertinism
      . . . . I beg that you will write nothing more about me to these two very
      dangerous personages.... Just now I will tell you of a little trick which
      I played on you, which without doubt deserves some punishment. The young,
      little Kasper, whom you formerly loved, came to ask me for the address of
      her dear Monsieur de Casanova, so that she could write a very tender
      letter full of recollections. I had too much politeness to wish to refuse
      a pretty girl, who was once the favorite of my lover, so just a request,
      so I gave her the address she wished; but I addressed the letter to a city
      far from you. Is it not, my dear friend, that you would like well to know
      the name of the city, so that you could secure the letter by posts. But
      you can depend on my word that you will not know it until you have written
      me a very long letter begging me very humbly to indicate the place where
      the divine letter of the adorable object of your vows has gone. You might
      well make this sacrifice for a girl in whom the Emperor [Joseph II]
      interests himself, for it is known that, since your departure from Vienna,
      it is he who is teaching her French and music; and apparently he takes the
      trouble of instructing her himself, for she often goes to his house to
      thank him for his kindnesses to her, but I know not in what way she
      expresses herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, my dear friend. Think sometimes of me and believe that I am
      your sincere friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the 23rd April 1785, the ambassador Foscarini died, depriving Casanova
      of a protector, probably leaving him without much money, and not in the
      best of health. He applied for the position of secretary to Count Fabris,
      his former friend, whose name had been changed from Tognolo, but without
      success. Casanova then determined to go to Berlin in the hope of a place
      in the Academy. On the 30th July he arrived at Bruen in Moravia, where his
      friend Maximilian-Joseph, Count Lamberg gave him, among other letters of
      recommendation, a letter addressed to Jean-Ferdinand Opiz, Inspector of
      Finances and Banks at Czaslau, in which he wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A celebrated man, M. Casanova, will deliver to you, my dear friend, the
      visiting card with which he is charged for Mme. Opiz and yourself. Knowing
      this amiable and remarkable man, will mark an epoch in your life, be
      polite and friendly to him, &lsquo;quod ipsi facies in mei memoriam faciatis&rsquo;.
      Keep yourself well, write to me, and if you can direct him to some honest
      man at Carlsbad, fail not to do so. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the 15th August 1785, M. Opiz wrote Count Lamberg about Casanova&rsquo;s
      visit:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your letter of the 30th, including your cards for my wife and myself, was
      delivered the first of this month by M. Casanova. He was very anxious to
      meet the Princess Lubomirski again at Carlsbad. But as something about his
      carriage was broken, he was obliged to stop in Czaslau for two hours which
      he passed in my company. He has left Czaslau with the promise of giving me
      a day on his return. I am already delighted. Even in the short space of
      time in which I enjoyed his company, I found in him a man worthy of our
      highest consideration and of our love, a benevolent philosopher whose
      homeland is the great expanse of our planet (and not Venice alone) and who
      values only the men in the kings . . . . I know absolutely no one at
      Carlsbad, so I sincerely regret being unable to recommend him to anyone
      there, according to your desire. He did not wish, on account of his haste,
      to pause even at Prague and, consequently, to deliver, at this time, your
      letter to Prince Furstemberg.&rdquo;

      I &mdash; THE CASTLE AT DUX
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is uncertain how long Casanova remained at Carlsbad. While there,
      however, he met again the Polish nobleman Zawoiski, with whom he had
      gambled in Venice in 1746. &ldquo;As to Zawoiski, I did not tell him the story
      until I met him in Carlsbad old and deaf, forty years later.&rdquo; He did not
      return to Czaslau, but in September 1785 he was at Teplitz where he found
      Count Waldstein whom he accompanied to his castle at Dux.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time onward he remained almost constantly at the castle where he
      was placed in charge of the Count&rsquo;s library and given a pension of one
      thousand florins annually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Describing his visit to the castle in 1899, Arthur Symons writes: &ldquo;I had
      the sensation of an enormous building: all Bohemian castles are big, but
      this one was like a royal palace. Set there in the midst of the town,
      after the Bohemian fashion, it opens at the back upon great gardens, as if
      it were in the midst of the country. I walked through room after room,
      corridor after corridor; everywhere there were pictures, everywhere
      portraits of Wallenstein, and battle scenes in which he led on his troops.
      The library, which was formed, or at least arranged, by Casanova, and
      which remains as he left it, contains some twenty-five thousand volumes,
      some of them of considerable value . . . . The library forms part of the
      Museum, which occupies a ground-floor wing of the castle. The first room
      is an armoury, in which all kinds of arms are arranged, in a decorative
      way, covering the ceiling and the walls with strange patterns. The second
      room contains pottery, collected by Casanova&rsquo;s Waldstein on his Eastern
      travels. The third room is full of curious mechanical toys, and cabinets,
      and carvings in ivory. Finally, we come to the library, contained in the
      two innermost rooms. The book shelves are painted white and reach to the
      low vaulted ceilings, which are whitewashed. At the end of a bookcase, in
      the corner of one of the windows, hangs a fine engraved portrait of
      Casanova.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this elaborate setting, Casanova found the refuge he so sadly needed
      for his last years. The evil days of Venice and Vienna, and the problems
      and makeshifts of mere existence, were left behind. And for this refuge he
      paid the world with his Memoirs.

      II &mdash; LETTERS FROM FRANCESCA
    </h2>
    <h3>
      In 1786, Casanova renewed his correspondence with Francesca, who wrote:
    </h3>
    <p>
      1st July 1786. &ldquo;After a silence of a year and a half, I received from you
      yesterday a good letter which has consoled me in informing me that you are
      in perfect health. But, on the other hand, I was much pained to see that
      in your letter you did not call me Friend, but Madame . . . . You have
      reason to chide me and to reproach me for having rented a house without
      surety or means of paying the rent. As to the advice you give me that if
      some honest person would pay me my rent, or at least a part of it, I
      should have no scruples about taking it because a little more, or a little
      less, would be of little importance . . . . I declare to you that I have
      been disconsolated at receiving from you such a reproach which is
      absolutely unjustified . . . . You tell me that you have near you a young
      girl who merits all your solicitations and your love, she and her family
      of six persons who adore you and give you every attention; that she costs
      you all you have, so that you cannot send me even a sou . . . . I am
      pained to hear you say that you will never return to Venice, and yet I
      hope to see you again. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;young girl&rdquo; referred to in Francesca&rsquo;s letter was Anna-Dorothea
      Kleer, daughter of the porter of the castle. This young girl became
      pregnant in 1786 and Casanova was accused of seducing her. The guilty one,
      however, was a painter named Schottner who married the unfortunate girl in
      January 1787.

      III &mdash; CORRESPONDENCE AND ACTIVITIES
    </h2>
    <p>
      In 1787, a book was published under the title of &lsquo;Dreissig Brief uber
      Galizien by Traunpaur&rsquo;, which included this passage: &ldquo;The most famous
      adventurers of two sorts (there are two, in fact: honest adventurers and
      adventurers of doubtful reputation) have appeared on the scene of the
      kingdom of Poland. The best known on the shores of the Vistula are: the
      miraculous Cagliostro: Boisson de Quency, grand charlatan, soldier of
      fortune, decorated with many orders, member of numerous Academies: the
      Venetian Casanova of Saint-Gall, a true savant, who fought a duel with
      Count Branicki: the Baron de Poellnitz . . . the lucky Count Tomatis, who
      knew so well how to correct fortune, and many others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In June 1789, Casanova received a letter from Teresa Boisson de Quency,
      the wife of the adventurer above referred to:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much honored Monsieur Giacomo:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a long time I have felt a very particular desire to evidence to you
      the estimation due your spirit and your eminent qualities: the superb
      sonnet augmented my wish. But the inconveniences of childbirth and the
      cares required by a little girl whom I adore, made me defer this pleasure.
      During my husband&rsquo;s absence, your last and much honored letter came to my
      hands. Your amiable compliments to me, engage me to take the pen to give
      you renewed assurance that you have in me a sincere admirer of your great
      talent . . . . When I wish to point out a person who writes and thinks
      with excellence, I name Monsieur Casanova . . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In 1793, Teresa de Quency wished to return to Venice at which time Zaguri
      wrote Casanova: &ldquo;The Bassani has received letters from her husband which
      tell her nothing more than that he is alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Casanova passed the months of May, June and July 1788 at Prague,
      supervising the printing of the Histoire de ma fuite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember laughing very heartily at Prague, six years ago, on learning
      that some thin-skinned ladies, on reading my flight from The Leads, which
      was published at that date, took great offense at the above account, which
      they thought I should have done well to leave out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In May he was troubled with an attack of the grippe. In October, he was in
      Dresden, apparently with his brother. Around this time &ldquo;The Magdalene,&rdquo; a
      painting by Correggio, was stolen from the Museum of the Elector.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 30th October 1788, Casanova wrote to the Prince Belozelski, Russian
      Minister to the Court of Dresden: &ldquo;Tuesday morning, after having embraced
      my dear brother, I got into a carriage to return here. At the barrier on
      the outskirts of Dresden, I was obliged to descend, and six men carried
      the two chests of my carriage, my two night-bags and my capelire into a
      little chamber on the ground level, demanded my keys, and examined
      everything . . . . The youngest of these infamous executors of such an
      order told me they were searching for &lsquo;The Magdalene! . . . The oldest had
      the impudence to put his hands on my waistcoat . . . . At last they let me
      go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, my prince, delayed me so that I could not reach Petervalden by
      daylight. I stopped at an evil tavern where, dying of famine and rage, I
      ate everything I saw; and, wishing to drink and not liking beer, I gulped
      down some beverage which my host told me was good and which did not seem
      unpleasant. He told me that it was Pilnitz Moste. This beverage aroused a
      rebellion in my guts. I passed the night tormented by a continual
      diarrhoea. I arrived here the day before yesterday (the 28th), where I
      found an unpleasant duty awaiting me. Two months ago, I brought a woman
      here to cook, needing her while the Count is away; as soon as she arrived,
      I gave her a room and I went to Leipzig. On returning here, I found three
      servants in the hands of surgeons and all three blame my cook for putting
      them in such a state. The Count&rsquo;s courier had already told me, at Leipzig,
      that she had crippled him. Yesterday the Count arrived and would do
      nothing but laugh, but I have sent her back and exhorted her to imitate
      the Magdalene. The amusing part is that she is old, ugly and
      ill-smelling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In 1789, 1791 and 1792, Casanova received three letters from Maddalena
      Allegranti, the niece of J. B. Allegranti the innkeeper with whom Casanova
      lodged at Florence in 1771. &ldquo;This young person, still a child, was so
      pretty, so gracious, with such spirit and such charms, that she
      incessantly distracted me. Sometimes she would come into my chamber to
      wish me good-morning . . . . Her appearance, her grace, the sound of her
      voice . . . were more than I could resist; and, fearing the seduction
      would excuse mine, I could find no other expedient than to take flight. .
      . . Some years later, Maddalena became a celebrated musician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this period of Casanova&rsquo;s life, we hear again of the hussy who so upset
      Casanova during his visit to London that he was actually on the point of
      committing suicide through sheer desperation. On the 20th September 1789,
      he wrote to the Princess Clari, sister of the Prince de Ligne: &ldquo;I am
      struck by a woman at first sight, she completely ravishes me, and I am
      perhaps lost, for she may be a Charpillon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were, among the papers at Dux, two letters from Marianne Charpillon,
      and a manuscript outlining the story of Casanova&rsquo;s relations with her and
      her family, as detailed in the Memoirs: With the story in mind, the
      letters from this girl, &ldquo;the mistress, now of one, now of another,&rdquo; are of
      interest:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not, Monsieur, whether you forgot the engagement Saturday last; as
      for me, I remember that you consented to give us the pleasure of having
      you at dinner to-day, Monday, the 12th of the month. I would greatly like
      to know whether your ill-humor has left you; this would please me.
      Farewell, in awaiting the honor of seeing you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marianne de Charpillon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I have a part in all which concerns you, I am greatly put out to know
      of the new illness which incommodes you; I hope that this will be so
      trifling that we will have the pleasure of seeing you well and at our
      house, to-day or to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, in truth, the gift which you sent me is so pretty that I know not
      how to express to you the pleasure it has given me and how much I value
      it; and I cannot see why you must always provoke me by telling me that it
      is my fault that you are filled with bile, while I am as innocent as a
      new-born babe and would wish you so gentle and patient that your blood
      would become a true clarified syrup; this will come to you if you follow
      my advice. I am, Monsieur,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your very humble servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;[Marianne Charpillon]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wednesday at six o&rsquo;clock&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the 8th April, 1790, Zaguri wrote in reference to vertigo of which
      Casanova complained: &ldquo;Have you tried riding horseback? Do you not think
      that is an excellent preservative? I tried it this last summer and I find
      myself very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In 1790, Casanova had a conversation with the Emperor Joseph II at
      Luxemburg, on the subject of purchased nobility, which he reports in the
      Memoirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This same year, attending the coronation of Leopold at Prague, Casanova
      met his grandson (and, probably, as he himself believed, his own son), the
      son of Leonilda, who was the daughter of Casanova and Donna Lucrezia, and
      who was married to the Marquis C . . . . In 1792, Leonilda wrote, inviting
      Casanova to &ldquo;spend the remainder of my days with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In February 1791, Casanova wrote to Countess Lamberg: &ldquo;I have in my
      capitularies more than four hundred sentences which pass for aphorisms and
      which include all the tricks which place one word for another. One can
      read in Livy that Hannibal overcame the Alps by means of vinegar. No
      elephant ever uttered such a stupidity. Livy? Not at all. Livy was not a
      beast; it is you who are, foolish instructor of credulous youth! Livy did
      not say aceto which means vinegar, but aceta which means axe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In April 1791, Casanova wrote to Carlo Grimani at Venice, stating that he
      felt he had committed a great fault in publishing his libel, &lsquo;Ne amori ne
      donne&rsquo;, and very humbly begging his pardon. Also that his Memoirs would be
      composed of six volumes in octavo with a seventh supplementary volume
      containing codicils.
    </p>
    <p>
      In June, Casanova composed for the theater of Princess Clari, at Teplitz,
      a piece entitled: &lsquo;Le Polemoscope ou la Calomnie demasquee par la presence
      d&rsquo;esprit, tragicomedie en trois actes&rsquo;. The manuscript was preserved at
      Dux, together with another form of the same, having the sub-title of &lsquo;La
      Lorgnette Menteuse ou la Calomnie demasquee&rsquo;. It may be assumed that the
      staging of this piece was an occasion of pleasant activity for Casanova.
    </p>
    <p>
      In January 1792, during Count Waldstein&rsquo;s absence in London or Paris,
      Casanova was embroiled with M. Faulkircher, maitre d&rsquo;hotel, over the
      unpleasant matter indicated in two of Casanova&rsquo;s letters to this
      functionary:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your rascally Vidierol . . . tore my portrait out of one of my books,
      scrawled my name on it, with the epithet which you taught him and then
      stuck it on the door of the privy ....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Determined to make sure of the punishment of your infamous valet, and
      wishing at the same time to give proof of my respect for Count Waldstein,
      not forgetting that, as a last resort, I have the right to invade his
      jurisdiction, I took an advocate, wrote my complaint and had it translated
      into German . . . . Having heard of this at Teplitz, and having known that
      I would not save your name, you came to my chamber to beg me to write
      whatever I wished but not to name you because it would place you wrong
      before the War Council and expose you to the loss of your pension . . . .
      I have torn up my first complaint and have written a second in Latin,
      which an advocate of Bilin has translated for me and which I have
      deposited at the office of the judiciary at Dux....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Following this matter, Casanova attended the Carnival at Oberleutensdorf,
      and left at Dux a manuscript headed &lsquo;Passe temps de Jacques Casanova de
      Seingalt pour le carnaval de l&rsquo;an 1792 dans le bourg d&rsquo;Oberleutensdorf&rsquo;.
      While in that city, meditating on the Faulkircher incident, he wrote also
      &lsquo;Les quinze pardons, monologue nocturne du bibliothecaire&rsquo;, also preserved
      in manuscript at Dux, in which we read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerron, having served twenty years as a simple soldier, acquired a great
      knowledge of military discipline. This man was not yet seventy years old.
      He had come to believe, partly from practice, partly from theory, that
      twenty blows with a baton on the rump are not dishonoring. When the honest
      soldier was unfortunate enough to deserve them, he accepted them with
      resignation. The pain was sharp, but not lasting; it did not deprive him
      of either appetite nor honor . . . . Gerron, becoming a corporal, had
      obtained no idea of any kind of sorrow other than that coming from the
      blows of a baton on the rump . . . . On this idea, he thought that the
      soul of an honest man was no different than a soldier&rsquo;s breech. If Gerron
      caused trouble to the spirit of a man of honor, he thought that this
      spirit, like his own, had only a rump, and that any trouble he caused
      would pass likewise. He deceived himself. The breech of the spirit of an
      honest man is different than the breech of the spirit of a Gerron who
      rendered compatible the rank of a military officer with the vile
      employments of a domestic and the stable-master of some particular lord.
      Since Gerron deceived himself, we must pardon him all his faults . . .&rdquo;
       etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Casanova complained of the Faulkircher incident to the mother of Count
      Waldstein, who wrote: &ldquo;I pity you, Monsieur, for being obliged to live
      among such people and in such evil company, but my son will not forget
      that which he owes to himself and I am sure he will give you all the
      satisfaction you wish.&rdquo; Also to his friend Zaguri, who wrote, the 16th
      March: &ldquo;I hope that the gout in your hand will not torment you any more. .
      . . You have told me the story I asked about and which begins: &lsquo;Two months
      have passed since an officer, who is at Vienna, insulted me!&rsquo; I cannot
      understand whether he who wrote you an insulting letter is at Vienna or
      whether he is at Dux. When will the Count return? . . . You should await
      his return because you would have, among other reasons to present to him,
      that of not wishing to have recourse to other jurisdiction than his. . .
      You say your letters have been intercepted? Someone has put your portrait
      in the privy? The devil! It is a miracle that you have not killed someone.
      Positively, I am curious to know the results and I hope that you make no
      mistakes in this affair which appears to me very delicate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In August 1792, or thereabouts, Da Ponte on his way to Dresden, visited
      Casanova at Dux, in the hope of collecting an old debt, but gave up this
      hope on realizing Casanova&rsquo;s limited resources. In the winter of 1792-3 Da
      Ponte found himself in great distress in Holland. &ldquo;Casanova was the only
      man to whom I could apply,&rdquo; he writes in his Memoirs. &ldquo;To better dispose
      him, I thought to write him in verse, depicting my troubles and begging
      him to send me some money on account of that which he still owed me. Far
      from considering my request, he contented himself with replying, in vulgar
      prose, by a laconic billet which I transcribe: &lsquo;When Cicero wrote to his
      friends, he avoided telling them of his affairs.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In May 1793, Da Ponte wrote from London: &ldquo;Count Waldstein has lived a very
      obscure life in London, badly lodged, badly dressed, badly served, always
      in cabarets, cafes, with porters, with rascals, with . . . we will leave
      out the rest. He has the heart of an angel and an excellent character, but
      not so good a head as ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toward the end of 1792, Cssanova wrote a letter to Robespierre, which, as
      he advises M. Opiz, the 13th January 1793, occupied one hundred and twenty
      folio pages. This letter was not to be found at Dux and it may possibly
      have been sent, or may have been destroyed by Casanova on the advice of
      Abbe O&rsquo;Kelly. Casanova&rsquo;s feelings were very bitter over the trial of Louis
      XVI., and in his letters to M. Opiz he complained bitterly of the Jacobins
      and predicted the ruin of France. Certainly, to Casanova, the French
      Revolution represented the complete overthrow of many of his cherished
      illusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 1st August 1793, Wilhelmina Rietz, Countess Lichtenau (called the
      Pompadour of Frederic-William II., King of Prussia) wrote to the librarian
      at Dux:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems impossible to know where Count Valstaine [Waldstein] is staying,
      whether he is in Europe, Africa, America, or possibly the Megamiques. If
      he is there, you are the only one who could insure his receiving the
      enclosed letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part, I have not yet had time to read their history, but the first
      reading I do will assuredly be that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Chappuis has the honor of recalling herself to your memory,
      and I have that of being your very humble servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilhelmina Rietz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The allusions to a &ldquo;history&rdquo; and to the &lsquo;Megamiques&rsquo; in this letter refer
      to Casanova&rsquo;s romance, &lsquo;Icosameron&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time, Count Waldstein returned to Dux after having been, at
      Paris, according to Da Ponte, concerned in planning the flight of Louis
      XVI., and in attempting to save the Princess Lamballe. On the 17th August,
      Casanova replied to the above letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I handed the Count your letter two minutes after having received it,
      finding him easily. I told him that he should respond at once, for the
      post was ready to go; but, as he begged to wait for the following
      ordinary, I did not insist. The day before yesterday, he begged me to wait
      again, but he did not find me so complaisant. I respond to you, Madame,
      for his carelessness in replying to letters is extreme; he is so shameful
      that he is in despair when he is obliged to it. Although he may not
      respond, be sure of seeing him at your house at Berlin after the Leipzig
      Fair, with a hundred bad excuses which you will laugh at and pretend to
      believe good ones . . . . This last month, my wish to see Berlin again has
      become immeasurable, and I will do my best to have Count Waldstein take me
      there in the month of October or at least to permit me to go . . . . You
      have given me an idea of Berlin far different than that the city left with
      me when I passed four months there twenty-nine years ago . . . . If my
      &lsquo;Icosameron&rsquo; interests you, I offer you its Spirit. I wrote it here two
      years ago and I would not have published it if I had not dared hope that
      the Theological Censor would permit it. At Berlin no one raised the least
      difficulty . . . . If circumstances do not permit me to pay you my
      respects at Berlin, I hope for the happiness of seeing you here next year
      . . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sometime after this and following his quarrel with M. Opiz, Casanova
      evidently passed through a period of depression, as indicated by a
      manuscript at Dux, headed &ldquo;Short reflection of a philosopher who finds
      himself thinking of procuring his own death,&rdquo; and dated &ldquo;the 13th December
      1793, the day dedicated to S. Lucie, remarkable in my too long life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life is a burden to me. What is the metaphysical being who prevents me
      from slaying myself? It is Nature. What is the other being who enjoins me
      to lighten the burdens of that life which brings me only feeble pleasures
      and heavy pains? It is Reason. Nature is a coward which, demanding only
      conservation, orders me to sacrifice all to its existence. Reason is a
      being which gives me resemblance to God, which treads instinct under foot
      and which teaches me to choose the best way after having well considered
      the reasons. It demonstrates to me that I am a man in imposing silence on
      the Nature which opposes that action which alone could remedy all my ills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reason convinces me that the power I have of slaying myself is a
      privilege given me by God, by which I perceive that I am superior to all
      animals created in the world; for there is no animal who can slay itself
      nor think of slaying itself, except the scorpion, which poisons itself,
      but only when the fire which surrounds it convinces it that it cannot save
      itself from being burned. This animal slays itself because it fears fire
      more than death. Reason tells me imperiously that I have the right to slay
      myself, with the divine oracle of Cen: &lsquo;Qui non potest vivere bene non
      vivat male.&rsquo; These eight words have such power that it is impossible that
      a man to whom life is a burden could do other than slay himself on first
      hearing them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, however, Casanova did not deceive himself with these sophisms,
      and Nature, who for many years had unquestionably lavished her gifts on
      him, had her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the end of the year, the two mathematicians, Casanova and Opiz, at
      the request of Count Waldstein, made a scientific examination of the
      reform of the calendar as decreed the 5th October 1793 by the National
      Convention.
    </p>
    <p>
      In January 1795, Casanova wrote to the Princess Lobkowitz to thank her for
      her gift of a little dog. On the 16th the Princess wrote from Vienna:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am enchanted at the charming reception you accorded the dog which I
      sent you when I learned of the death of your well-loved greyhound, knowing
      that she would nowhere be better cared for than with you, Monsieur. I hope
      with all my heart that she has all the qualities which may, in some
      fashion, help you to forget the deceased . . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the autumn of 1795, Casanova left Dux. The Prince de Ligne writes in
      his Memoirs: &ldquo;God directed him to leave Dux. Scarcely believing in more
      than his death, which he no longer doubted, he pretended that each thing
      he had done was by the direction of God and this was his guide. God
      directed him to ask me for letters of recommendation to the Duke of
      Weimar, who was my good friend, to the Duchess of Gotha, who did not know
      me, and to the Jews of Berlin. And he departed secretly, leaving for Count
      Waldstein a letter at once tender, proud, honest and irritating. Waldstein
      laughed and said he would return. Casanova waited in ante-chambers; no one
      would place him either as governor, librarian or chamberlain. He said
      everywhere that the Germans were thorough beasts. The excellent and very
      amiable Duke of Weimer welcomed him wonderfully; but in an instant he
      became jealous of Goethe and Wieland, who were under the Duke&rsquo;s
      protection. He declaimed against them and against the literature of the
      country which he did not, and could not, know. At Berlin, he declaimed
      against the ignorance, the superstition and the knavery of the Hebrews to
      whom I had addressed him, drawing meanwhile, for the money they claimed of
      him, bills of exchange on the Count who laughed, paid, and embraced him
      when he returned. Casanova laughed, wept, and told him that God had
      ordered him to make this trip of six weeks, to leave without speaking of
      it, and to return to his chamber at Dux. Enchanted at seeing us again, he
      agreeably related to us all the misfortunes which had tried him and to
      which his susceptibility gave the name of humiliations. &lsquo;I am proud,&rsquo; he
      said, &lsquo;because I am nothing&rsquo;. . . . Eight days after his return, what new
      troubles! Everyone had been served strawberries before him, and none
      remained for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince de Ligne, although he was Casanova&rsquo;s sincere friend and
      admirer, gives a rather somber picture of Casanova&rsquo;s life at Dux: &ldquo;It must
      not be imagined that he was satisfied to live quietly in the refuge
      provided him through the kindness of Waldstein. That was not within his
      nature. Not a day passed without trouble; something was certain to be
      wrong with the coffee, the milk, the dish of macaroni, which he required
      each day. There were always quarrels in the house. The cook had ruined his
      polenta; the coachman had given him a bad driver to bring him to see me;
      the dogs had barked all night; there had been more guests than usual and
      he had found it necessary to eat at a side table. Some hunting-horn had
      tormented his ear with its blasts; the priest had been trying to convert
      him; Count Waldstein had not anticipated his morning greeting; the servant
      had delayed with his wine; he had not been introduced to some
      distinguished personage who had come to see the lance which had pierced
      the side of the great Wallenstein; the Count had lent a book without
      telling him; a groom had not touched his hat to him; his German speech had
      been misunderstood; he had become angry and people had laughed at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like Count Waldstein, however, the Prince de Ligne made the widest
      allowances, understanding the chafing of Casanova&rsquo;s restless spirit.
      &ldquo;Casanova has a mind without an equal, from which each word is
      extraordinary and each thought a book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the 16th December, he wrote Casanova: &ldquo;One is never old with your
      heart, your genius and your stomach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Casanova&rsquo;s own comment on his trip away from Dux will be found in the
      Memoirs. &ldquo;Two years ago, I set out for Hamburg, but my good genius made me
      return to Dux. What had I to do at Hamburg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the 10th December, Casanova&rsquo;s brother Giovanni [Jean] died. He was the
      Director of the Academy of Painting at Dresden. Apparently the two
      brothers could not remain friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giovanni left two daughters, Teresa and Augusta, and two sons, Carlo and
      Lorenzo. While he was unable to remain friendly with his brother, Casanova
      apparently wished to be of assistance to his nieces, who were not in the
      best of circumstances, and he exchanged a number of letters with Teresa
      after her father&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the occasion of Teresa Casanova&rsquo;s visit to Vienna in 1792, Princess
      Clari, oldest sister of the Prince de Ligne, wrote of her: &ldquo;She is
      charming in every way, pretty as love, always amiable; she has had great
      success. Prince Kaunitz loves her to the point of madness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a letter of the 25th April 1796, Teresa assured her &ldquo;very amiable and
      very dear uncle&rdquo; that the cautions, which occupied three-fourths of his
      letter, were unnecessary; and compared him with his brother Francois, to
      the injury of the latter. On the 5th May, Teresa wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before thanking you for your charming letter, my very kind uncle, I
      should announce the issue of our pension of one hundred and sixty crowns a
      year, which is to say, eighty crowns apiece; I am well satisfied for I did
      not hope to receive so much.&rdquo; In the same letter, Teresa spoke of seeing
      much of a &ldquo;charming man,&rdquo; Don Antonio, who was no other than the rascally
      adventurer Don Antonio della Croce with whom Casanova had been acquainted
      since 1753, who assisted Casanova in losing a thousand sequins at Milan in
      1763; who in 1767, at Spa, following financial reverses, abandoned his
      pregnant mistress to the charge of Casanova; and who in August 1795, wrote
      to Casanova: &ldquo;Your letter gave me great pleasure as the sweet souvenir of
      our old friendship, unique and faithful over a period of fifty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is probable that, at this time, Casanova visited Dresden and Berlin
      also. In his letter &ldquo;To Leonard Snetlage,&rdquo; he writes: &ldquo;&lsquo;That which proves
      that revolution should arrive,&rsquo; a profound thinker said to me in Berlin,
      last year, &lsquo;is that it has arrived.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the 1st March, 1798, Carlo Angiolini, the son of Maria Maddalena,
      Casanova&rsquo;s sister, wrote to Casanova: &ldquo;This evening, Teresa will marry M.
      le Chambellan de Veisnicht [Von Wessenig] whom you know well.&rdquo; This
      desirable marriage received the approval of Francesco also. Teresa, as the
      Baroness Wessenig, occupied a prominent social position at Dresden. She
      died in 1842.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the 13th February and the 6th December 1796, Casanova engaged in a
      correspondence with Mlle. Henriette de Schuckmann who was visiting at
      Bayreuth. This Henriette (unfortunately not the Henriette of the Memoirs
      whose &ldquo;forty letters&rdquo; to Casanova apparently have not been located), had
      visited the library at Dux in the summer of 1786. &ldquo;I was with the
      Chamberlain Freiberg, and I was greatly moved, as much by your
      conversation as by your kindness which provided me with a beautiful
      edition of Metastasio, elegantly bound in red morocco.&rdquo; Finding herself at
      Bayreuth in an enforced idleness and wishing a stimulant, wishing also to
      borrow some books, she wrote Casanova, under the auspices of Count Koenig,
      a mutual friend, the 13th February 1796, recalling herself to his memory.
      Casanova responded to her overtures and five of her letters were preserved
      at Dux. On the 28th May Henriette wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But certainly, my good friend, your letters have given me the greatest
      pleasure, and it is with a rising satisfaction that I pore over all you
      say to me. I love, I esteem, I cherish, your frankness . . . . I
      understand you perfectly and I love to distraction the lively and
      energetic manner with which you express yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the 30th September, she wrote: &ldquo;You will read to-day, if you please, a
      weary letter; for your silence, Monsieur, has given me humors. A promise
      is a debt, and in your last letter you promised to write me at least a
      dozen pages. I have every right to call you a bad debtor; I could summon
      you before a court of justice; but all these acts of vengeance would not
      repair the loss which I have endured through my hope and my fruitless
      waiting . . . . It is your punishment to read this trivial page; but
      although my head is empty, my heart is not so, and it holds for you a very
      living friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In March 1797, this Henriette went to Lausanne and in May from there to
      her father&rsquo;s home at Mecklenburg.

    <h2>
      IV &mdash; CORRESPONDENCE WITH JEAN-FERDINAND OPIZ
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the 27th July 1792, Casanova wrote M. Opiz that he had finished the
      twelfth volume of his Memoirs, with his age at forty-seven years 1772.
      &ldquo;Our late friend, the worthy Count Max Josef Lamberg,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;could
      not bear the idea of my burning my Memoirs, and expecting to survive me,
      had persuaded me to send him the first four volumes. But now there is no
      longer any questions that his good soul has left his organs. Three weeks
      ago I wept for his death, all the more so as he would still be living if
      he had listened to me. I am, perhaps, the only one who knows the truth. He
      who slew him was the surgeon Feuchter at Cremsir, who applied thirty-six
      mercurial plasters on a gland in his left groin which was swollen but not
      by the pox, as I am sure by the description he gave me of the cause of the
      swelling. The mercury mounted to his esophagus and, being able to swallow
      neither solids nor fluids, he died the 23rd June of positive famine . . .
      . The interest of the bungling surgeon is to say that he died of the pox.
      This is not true, I beg, you to give the lie to anyone you hear saying it.
      I have before my eyes four hundred and sixty of his letters over which I
      weep and which I will burn. I have asked Count Leopold to burn mine, which
      he had saved, and I hope that he will please me by doing it. I have
      survived all my true friends. &lsquo;Tempus abire mihi est&rsquo; Horace says to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Returning to my Memoirs . . . I am a detestable man; but I do not care
      about having it known, and I do not aspire to the honor of the detestation
      of posterity. My work is full of excellent moral instructions. But to what
      good, if the charming descriptions of my offences excite the readers more
      to action than to repentance? Furthermore, knowing readers would divine
      the names of all the women and of the men which I have masked, whose
      transgressions are unknown to the world, my indiscretion would injure
      them, they would cry out against my perfidy, even though every word of my
      history were true . . . . Tell me yourself whether or not I should burn my
      work? I am curious to have your advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the 6th May 1793, Casanova wrote Opiz: &ldquo;The letter of recommendation
      you ask of me to the professor my brother for your younger son, honors me;
      and there is no doubt that, having for you all the estimation your
      qualities merit, I should send it to you immediately. But this cannot be.
      And here is the reason. My brother is my enemy; he has given me sure
      indications of it and it appears that his hate will not cease until I no
      longer exist. I hope that he may long survive me and be happy. This desire
      is my only apology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The epigraph of the little work which I would give to the public,&rdquo;
       Casanova wrote the 23rd August 1793, &ldquo;is &lsquo;In pondere et mensura&rsquo;. It is
      concerned with gravity and measure. I would demonstrate not only that the
      course of the stars is irregular but also that it is susceptible only to
      approximate measures and that consequently we must join physical and moral
      calculations in establishing celestial movements. For I prove that all
      fixed axes must have a necessarily irregular movement of oscillation, from
      which comes a variation in all the necessary curves of the planets which
      compose their eccentricities and their orbits. I demonstrate that light
      has neither body nor spirit; I demonstrate that it comes in an instant
      from its respective star; I demonstrate the impossibility of many
      parallaxes and the uselessness of many others. I criticize not only
      Tiko-Brahi, but also Kepler and Newton . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to send you my manuscript and give you the trouble of publishing
      it with my name at Prague or elsewhere . . . . I will sell it to the
      printer or to yourself for fifty florins and twenty-five copies on fine
      paper when it is printed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Opiz replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the father of a family, I do not feel myself authorized to dispose of
      my revenues on the impulse of my fancy or as my heart suggests.... and no
      offer of yours could make me a book-seller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This shows plainly enough that Opiz, for all his interest in Casanova, had
      not the qualities of true friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 6th September 1793, Casanova wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will have my Reveries printed at Dresden, and I will be pleased to send
      you a copy. I laughed a little at your fear that I would take offense
      because you did not want my manuscript by sending me the ridiculous sum I
      named to you. This refusal, my dear friend, did not offend me. On the
      contrary it was useful as an aid in knowing character. Add to this that in
      making the offer I thought to make you a gift. Fear nothing from the
      event. Your system of economy will never interfere with either my
      proceedings or my doctrines; and I am in no need of begging you, for I
      think that your action followed only your inclination and consequently
      your greatest pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the insistence of Opiz, Casanova continued his correspondence, but he
      passed over nothing more, neither in exact quotations from Latin authors,
      nor solecisms, nor lame reasonings. He even reproached him for his poor
      writing and did not cease joking at the philanthropic and amiable
      sentiments Opiz loved to parade while at the same time keeping his
      purse-strings tight. A number of quarreling letters followed, after which
      the correspondence came to an end. One of Casanova&rsquo;s last letters, that of
      the 2nd February 1794, concludes: &ldquo;One day M. de Bragadin said to me:
      &lsquo;Jacques, be careful never to convince a quibbler, for he will become your
      enemy.&rsquo; After this wise advice I avoided syllogism, which tended toward
      conviction. But in spite of this you have become my enemy. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Among the Casanova manuscripts at Dux was one giving his final comment on
      his relations with Opiz. Accusing Opiz of bringing about a quarrel,
      Casanova nevertheless admits that he himself may not be blameless, but
      lays this to his carelessness. &ldquo;I have a bad habit,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;of not
      reading over my letters. If, in re-reading those I wrote to M. Opiz, I had
      found them bitter, I would have burned them.&rdquo; Probably Casanova struck the
      root of the matter in his remark, &ldquo;Perfect accord is the first charm of a
      reciprocal friendship.&rdquo; The two men were primarily of so different a
      temperament, that they apparently could not long agree even on subjects on
      which they were most in accord.
    </p>
    <p>
      The complete correspondence is of very considerable interest.

    <h2>
      V &mdash; PUBLICATIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      In 1786, Casanova published &lsquo;Le soliloque d&rsquo;un penseur&rsquo;, in which he
      speaks of Saint-Germain and of Cagliostro. On the 23rd December 1792,
      Zaguri wrote Casanova that Cagliostro was in prison at San Leo. &ldquo;Twenty
      years ago, I told Cagliostro not to set his foot in Rome, and if he had
      followed this advice he would not have died miserably in a Roman prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In January 1788, appeared &lsquo;Icosameron&rsquo; a romance in five volumes,
      dedicated to Count Waldstein, which he describes as &ldquo;translated from the
      English.&rdquo; This fanciful romance, which included philosophic and
      theological discussions, was the original work of Casanova and not a
      translation. It was criticized in 1789 by a literary journal at Jena.
      Preserved at Dux were several manuscripts with variants of &lsquo;Icosameron&rsquo;
      and also an unpublished reply to the criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1788 Casanova published the history of his famous flight from &ldquo;The
      Leads&rdquo;. An article on this book appeared in the German
      &lsquo;Litteratur-Zeitung&rsquo;, 29th June 1789: &ldquo;As soon as the history was
      published and while it was exciting much interest among us and among our
      neighbors, it was seen that other attempts at flight from prisons would
      make their appearance. The subject in itself is captivating; all prisoners
      awake our compassion, particularly when they are enclosed in a severe
      prison and are possibly innocent . . . . The history with which we are
      concerned has all the appearances of truth; many Venetians have testified
      to it, and the principal character, M. Casanova, brother of the celebrated
      painter, actually lives at Dux in Bohemia where the Count Waldstein has
      established him as guardian of his important library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In July 1789 there was discovered, among the papers of the Bastille, the
      letter which Casanova wrote from Augsburg in May 1767 to Prince Charles of
      Courlande on the subject of fabricating gold. Carrel published this letter
      at once in the third volume of his &lsquo;Memoirs authentiques et historiques
      sur la Bastille&rsquo;. Casanova kept a copy of this letter and includes it in
      the Memoirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In October 1789, Casanova wrote M. Opiz that he was writing to a professor
      of mathematics [M. Lagrange] at Paris, a long letter in Italian, on the
      duplication of the cube, which he wished to publish. In August 1790,
      Casanova published his &lsquo;Solution du Probleme Deliaque demontree and Deux
      corollaires a la duplication de hexadre&rsquo;. On the subject of his pretended
      solution of this problem in speculative mathematics, Casanova engaged with
      M. Opiz in a heated technical discussion between the 16th September and
      1st November 1790. Casanova sought vainly to convince Opiz of the
      correctness of his solution. Finally, M. Opiz, tired of the polemics,
      announced that he was leaving on a six-weeks tour of inspection and that
      he would not be able to occupy himself with the duplication of the cube
      for some time to come. On the 1st November, Casanova wished him a pleasant
      journey and advised him to guard against the cold because &ldquo;health is the
      soul of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In 1797, appeared the last book published during Casanova&rsquo;s lifetime, a
      small work entitled: &lsquo;A Leonard Snetlage, docteur en droit de l&rsquo;Universite
      de Goettingue, Jacques Casanova, docteur en droit de l&rsquo;Universite de
      Padoue&rsquo;. This was a careful criticism of the neologisms introduced into
      French by the Revolution. In reference to Casanova&rsquo;s title of &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo;
       researches by M. Favoro at the University of Padua had failed to establish
      this claim, although, in the Memoirs Casanova had written:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remained at Padua long enough to prepare myself for the Doctor&rsquo;s
      degree, which I intended to take the following year.&rdquo; With this devil of a
      man, it is always prudent to look twice before peremptorily questioning
      the truth of his statement. And in fact, the record of Casanova&rsquo;s
      matriculation was discovered by Signor Bruno Brunelli.

    <h2>
      VI &mdash; SUMMARY of MY LIFE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The 2nd November, 1797, Cecilia Roggendorff wrote to Casanova: &ldquo;By the
      way, how do you call yourself, by your baptismal name? On what day and in
      what year were you born? You may laugh, if you wish, at my questions, but
      I command you to satisfy me . . .&rdquo; To this request, Casanova responded
      with:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Summary of My Life:&mdash;my mother brought me into the world at Venice
      on the 2nd April, Easter day of the year 1725. She had, the night before,
      a strong desire for crawfish. I am very fond of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At baptism, I was named Jacques-Jerome. I was an idiot until I was
      eight-and-a-half years old. After having had a hemorrhage for three
      months, I was taken to Padua, where, cured of my imbecility, I applied
      myself to study and, at the age of sixteen years I was made a doctor and
      given the habit of a priest so that I might go seek my fortune at Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Rome, the daughter of my French instructor was the cause of my being
      dismissed by my patron, Cardinal Aquaviva.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the age of eighteen years, I entered the military service of my
      country, and I went to Constantinople. Two years afterward, having
      returned to Venice, I left the profession of honor and, taking the bit in
      my teeth, embraced the wretched profession of a violinist. I horrified my
      friends, but this did not last for very long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the age of twenty-one years, one of the highest nobles of Venice
      adopted me as his son, and, having become rich, I went to see Italy,
      France, Germany and Vienna where I knew Count Roggendorff. I returned to
      Venice, where, two years later, the State Inquisitors of Venice, for just
      and wise reasons, imprisoned me under The Leads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was the state prison, from which no one had ever escaped, but, with
      the aid of God, I took flight at the end of fifteen months and went to
      Paris. In two years, my affairs prospered so well that I became worth a
      million, but, all the same, I went bankrupt. I made money in Holland;
      suffered misfortune in Stuttgart; was received with honors in Switzerland;
      visited M. de Voltaire; adventured in Genoa, Marseilles, Florence and in
      Rome where the Pope Rezzonico, a Venetian, made me a Chevalier of
      Saint-Jean-Latran and an apostolic protonotary. This was in the year 1760.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the same year I found good fortune at Naples; at Florence I carried
      off a girl; and, the following year, I was to attend the Congress at
      Augsburg, charged with a commission from the King of Portugal. The
      Congress did not meet there and, after the publication of peace, I passed
      on into England, which great misfortunes caused me to leave in the
      following year, 1764. I avoided the gibbet which, however, should not have
      dishonored me as I should only have been hung. In the same year I searched
      in vain for fortune at Berlin and at Petersburg, but I found it at Warsaw
      in the following year. Nine months afterwards, I lost it through being
      embroiled in a pistol duel with General Branicki; I pierced his abdomen
      but in eight months he was well again and I was very much pleased. He was
      a brave man. Obliged to leave Poland, I returned to Paris in 1767, but a
      &lsquo;lettre de cachet&rsquo; obliged me to leave and I went to Spain where I met
      with great misfortunes. I committed the crime of making nocturnal visits
      to the mistress of the &lsquo;vice-roi&rsquo;, who was a great scoundrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the frontiers of Spain, I escaped from assassins only to suffer, at
      Aix, in Provence, an illness which took me to the edge of the grave, after
      spitting blood for eighteen months.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the year 1769, I published my Defense of the Government of Venice, in
      three large volumes, written against Amelot de la Houssaie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the following year the English Minister at the Court of Turin sent me,
      well recommended, to Leghorn. I wished to go to Constantinople with the
      Russian fleet, but as Admiral Orlof, would not meet my conditions, I
      retraced my steps and went to Rome under the pontificate of Ganganelli.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A happy love affair made me leave Rome and go to Naples and, three months
      later, an unhappy love made me return to Rome. I had measured swords for
      the third time with Count Medini who died four years ago at London, in
      prison for his debts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having considerable money, I went to Florence, where, during the
      Christmas Festival, the Archduke Leopold, the Emperor who died four or
      five years ago, ordered me to leave his dominions within three days. I had
      a mistress who, by my advice, became Marquise de * * * at Bologna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weary of running about Europe, I determined to solicit mercy from the
      Venetian State Inquisitors. For this purpose, I established myself at
      Trieste where, two years later, I obtained it. This was the 14th September
      1774. My return to Venice after nineteen years was the most pleasant
      moment of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In 1782, I became embroiled with the entire body of the Venetian
      nobility. At the beginning of 1783, I voluntarily left the ungrateful
      country and went to Vienna. Six months later I went to Paris with the
      intention of establishing myself there, but my brother, who had lived
      there for twenty-six years, made me forget my interests in favor of his. I
      rescued him from the hands of his wife and took him to Vienna where Prince
      Kaunitz engaged him to establish himself. He is still there, older than I
      am by two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I placed myself in the service of M. Foscarini, Venetian Ambassador, to
      write dispatches. Two years later, he died in my arms, killed by the gout
      which mounted into his chest. I then set out for Berlin in the hope of
      securing a position with the Academy, but, half way there, Count Waldstein
      stopped me at Teplitz and led me to Dux where I still am and where,
      according to all appearances, I shall die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the only summary of my life that I have written, and I permit any
      use of it which may be desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Non erubesco evangelium&rsquo;.

      &ldquo;This 17th November 1797.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacques Casanova.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In reference to Casanova&rsquo;s ironic remark about his escape from England,
      see his conversation, on the subject of &ldquo;dishonor,&rdquo; with Sir Augustus
      Hervey at London in 1763, which is given in the Memoirs.

    <h2>
      VII &mdash; LAST DAYS AT DUX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Scattered through the Memoirs are many of Casanova&rsquo;s thoughts about his
      old age. Some were possibly incorporated in the original text, others
      possibly added when he revised the text in 1797. These vary from
      resignation to bitterness, doubtless depending on Casanova&rsquo;s state of mind
      at the moment he wrote them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that I am seventy-two years old, I believe myself no longer
      susceptible of such follies. But alas! that is the very thing which causes
      me to be miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate old age which offers only what I already know, unless I should
      take up a gazette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Age has calmed my passions by rendering them powerless, but my heart has
      not grown old and my memory has kept all the freshness of youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have not forgotten her [Henriette]; for even now, when my head is
      covered with white hair, the recollection of her is still a source of
      happiness for my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A scene which, even now, excites my mirth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Age, that cruel and unavoidable disease, compels me to be in good health,
      in spite of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that I am but the shadow of the once brilliant Casanova, I love to
      chatter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that age has whitened my hair and deadened the ardor of my senses, my
      imagination does not take such a high flight and I think differently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What embitters my old age is that, having a heart as warm as ever, I have
      no longer the strength necessary to secure a single day as blissful as
      those which I owed to this charming girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I recall these events, I grow young again and feel once more the
      delights of youth, despite the long years which separate me from that
      happy time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that I am getting into my dotage, I look on the dark side of
      everything. I am invited to a wedding and see naught but gloom; and,
      witnessing the coronation of Leopold II, at Prague, I say to myself, &lsquo;Nolo
      coronari&rsquo;. Cursed old age, thou art only worthy of dwelling in hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The longer I live, the more interest I take in my papers. They are the
      treasure which attaches me to life and makes death more hateful still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so on, through the Memoirs, Casanova supplies his own picture, knowing
      very well that the end, even of his cherished memories, is not far
      distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1797, Casanova relates an amusing, but irritating incident, which
      resulted in the loss of the first three chapters of the second volume of
      the Memoirs through the carelessness of a servant girl at Dux who took the
      papers &ldquo;old, written upon, covered with scribbling and erasures,&rdquo; for &ldquo;her
      own purposes,&rdquo; thus necessitating a re-writing, &ldquo;which I must now
      abridge,&rdquo; of these chapters. Thirty years before, Casanova would doubtless
      have made love to the girl and all would have been forgiven. But, alas for
      the &ldquo;hateful old age&rdquo; permitting no relief except irritation and impotent
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 1st August, 1797, Cecilia Roggendorff, the daughter of the Count
      Roggendorff [printed Roquendorf] whom Casanova had met at Vienna in 1753,
      wrote: &ldquo;You tell me in one of your letters that, at your death, you will
      leave me, by your will, your Memoirs which occupy twelve volumes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this time, Casanova was revising, or had completed his revision of, the
      twelve volumes. In July 1792, as mentioned above, Casanova wrote Opiz that
      he had arrived at the twelfth volume. In the Memoirs themselves we read,
      &ldquo;. . . the various adventures which, at the age of seventy-two years,
      impel me to write these Memoirs . . .,&rdquo; written probably during a revision
      in 1797.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of one of the two chapters of the last volume, which were
      missing until discovered by Arthur Symons at Dux in 1899, we read: &ldquo;When I
      left Venice in the year 1783, God ought to have sent me to Rome, or to
      Naples, or to Sicily, or to Parma, where my old age, according to all
      appearances, might have been happy. My genius, who is always right, led me
      to Paris, so that I might see my brother Francois, who had run into debt
      and who was just then going to the Temple. I do not care whether or not he
      owes me his regeneration, but I am glad to have effected it. If he had
      been grateful to me, I should have felt myself paid; it seems to me much
      better that he should carry the burden of his debt on his shoulders, which
      from time to time he ought to find heavy. He does not deserve a worse
      punishment. To-day, in the seventy-third year of my life, my only desire
      is to live in peace and to be far from any person who might imagine that
      he has rights over my moral liberty, for it is impossible that any kind of
      tyranny should not coincide with this imagination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Early in February, 1798, Casanova was taken sick with a very grave bladder
      trouble of which he died after suffering for three-and-a-half months. On
      the 16th February Zaguri wrote: &ldquo;I note with the greatest sorrow the blow
      which has afflicted you.&rdquo; On the 31st March, after having consulted with a
      Prussian doctor, Zaguri sent a box of medicines and he wrote frequently
      until the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 20th April Elisa von der Recke, whom Casanova had met, some years
      before, at the chateau of the Prince de Ligne at Teplitz, having returned
      to Teplitz, wrote: &ldquo;Your letter, my friend, has deeply affected me.
      Although myself ill, the first fair day which permits me to go out will
      find me at your side.&rdquo; On the 27th, Elisa, still bedridden, wrote that the
      Count de Montboisier and his wife were looking forward to visiting
      Casanova. On the 6th May she wrote, regretting that she was unable to send
      some crawfish soup, but that the rivers were too high for the peasants to
      secure the crawfish. &ldquo;The Montboisier family, Milady Clark, my children
      and myself have all made vows for your recovery.&rdquo; On the 8th, she sent
      bouillon and madeira.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
On the 4th June, 1798, Casanova died. His nephew, Carlo Angiolini was
with him at the time. He was buried in the churchyard of Santa Barbara at
Dux. The exact location of his grave is uncertain, but a tablet, placed
against the outside wall of the church reads:

    JAKOB

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
